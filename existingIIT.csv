"Two large, identical water tanks, 1 and 2, kept on the top of a building of height $H$, are filled with water up to height $h$ in each tank. Both the tanks contain an identical hole of small radius on their sides, close to their bottom. A pipe of the same internal radius as that of the hole is connected to tank 2, and the pipe ends at the ground level. When the water flows from the tanks 1 and 2 through the holes, the times taken to empty the tanks are $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$, respectively. If $H=\left(\frac{16}{9}\right) h$, then the ratio $t_{1} / t_{2}$ is $\qquad$ .\\"
"A metal target with atomic number $Z = 46$ is bombarded with a high energy electron beam. The emission of X-rays from the target is analyzed.

"A particle of mass $m$ is under the influence of the gravitational field of a body of mass $M \gg m$. The particle is moving in a circular orbit of radius $r_0$ with time period $T_0$ around the mass $M$. Then, the particle is subjected to an additional central force, corresponding to the potential energy $V_c(r) = \frac{m\alpha}{r^3}$, where $\alpha$ is a positive constant and $r$ is the distance from the center of the orbit. If the particle moves in the same circular orbit of radius $r_0$ in the combined gravitational potential due to $M$ and $V_c(r)$, but with a new time period $T_1$, then $\frac{T_1^2 - T_0^2}{T_1^2}$ is given by"
