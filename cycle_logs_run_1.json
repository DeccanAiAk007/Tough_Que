    "feedback": "Several points in the prompt compromise clarity and physical coherence. \n\nAmbiguities \u2013 \u201cinserting\u201d a freely rotating 1.20 m rod into a straight tube with zero clearance yet \u201cwithout adding any extra motion\u201d is physically impossible unless additional (ignored) forces act; the phrase \u201cwithout loss of generality\u201d hand-waves this contradiction.  The tube is said to constrain only the centre-of-mass but not the orientation, yet a real tube would almost certainly torque or collide with the rod as it rotates; the promise that the rod \u201cnever touches the tube ends\u201d does not resolve side-wall contact.  The spring force is applied \u201cby the tube walls on the rod's centre of mass\u201d, but a wall force acting strictly at the CM is non-physical and contradicts the earlier statement that translation and rotation are \u201cfully decoupled\u201d.  The sign convention for the fictitious force in the tube frame is left implicit: at y = 0 the stated spring force is zero, so the CM can only start moving if one assumes an unspoken downward pseudo-force \u2212Ma_tube; this should be stated explicitly.\n\nConsistency \u2013 Length L, impulse magnitude J and lever arms x_A, x_B are meticulously specified, yet the net linear impulse is zero, making every rotational datum irrelevant to the requested y_max.  Likewise g is introduced as a \u201cbook-keeping device\u201d but never quantified or used.  Symbol a_{tube} is clear, but the problem later speaks of the \u201cinstantaneous rest frame of the tube\u201d, while a_{tube} is constant; the distinction between lab frame and tube frame is muddled but crucial to sign conventions.\n\nLogical flow \u2013 The question leaps from an impulse scenario to a 1-D piecewise oscillator without justifying why rotational motion never couples back (e.g. through time-varying wall contact).  Claiming \u201crotational and translational dynamics are fully decoupled under the conditions given\u201d is an assertion, not a demonstrated result.\n\nAssumptions \u2013 Neglecting wall/rod torques, clearance, and insertion dynamics are strong hidden assumptions; the spring constants k\u2081, k\u2082 implicitly act for all |y| with no physical limit, an unrealistic idealisation that should be declared.  No reason is given for the piecewise stiffness; it is physically irrelevant but complicates the mathematics.\n\nSingle-answer criterion \u2013 The prompt does end with one boxed quantity, so that part is satisfied; however the surplus rotational data and mention of g encourage unnecessary intermediate work.\n\nIn short, delete the rotational/impulse back-story or explicitly state it is irrelevant, clarify how the CM experiences a spring force while free to rotate, declare the fictitious force in the tube frame, and justify (or drop) the claim of complete translation\u2013rotation decoupling.",

    "feedback": "Ambiguities and missing definitions: \u201cproper acceleration\u201d is invoked but never distinguished from ordinary coordinate acceleration; if a relativistic meaning is intended, the frame-dependence of 3.70 m s\u207b\u00b2 should be clarified or, if speeds are assumed non-relativistic, the adjective \u201cproper\u201d is superfluous and potentially misleading.  The statement \u201cmechanical energy in the tube frame is conserved\u201d is asserted without argument; energy conservation in a uniformly accelerating, non-inertial frame is only valid because the pseudo-force derives from a time-independent potential U_in = M a_tube y\u2014this should be stated explicitly.  The piecewise spring law for y<0 is irrelevant for the \u201cfirst excursion\u201d (the mass never enters y<0 after an initial positive kick), yet the parameter k\u2081 is introduced and never used, inviting confusion.  All symbols (M, k\u2081, k\u2082, a_tube, v\u2080, y_max) are defined, but \u1e8f(t) and \u201cproper acceleration\u201d appear before being contextualised.  Logical flow is otherwise sound: energy at y=0 (\u00bdMv\u2080\u00b2) equals the sum \u00bdk\u2082y_max\u00b2 + M a_tube y_max at the turning point, but this reasoning chain is not spelled out, so a reader must supply it.  Hidden assumptions: gravity is declared absent but the physical realism of a frictionless, infinitely long, perfectly rigid tube in flat space with no gravity is not addressed; likewise, the laser pulse is idealised as an instantaneous momentum transfer with no position change.  No intermediate sub-questions are posed and the final request is a single numeric value in SI units, so the overall structure satisfies the \u201csingle answer\u201d requirement.  To tighten the problem, drop k\u2081 or postpone its introduction, replace \u201cproper\u201d with \u201cconstant\u201d acceleration (or state \u201crelativistic effects are negligible\u201d), and explicitly mention the inertial potential U_in to justify energy conservation.",
