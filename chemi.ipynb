      "  \"question\": \"A sealed cylindrical quartz flask (volume $V = 2.000 \\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}^3$) at $T = 298.15\\\\ \\\\mathrm{K}$ contains $n_\\\\mathrm{NH_3,0} = 3.000\\\\ \\\\mathrm{mol}$ of anhydrous ammonia and $n_\\\\mathrm{N_2,0} = 7.000\\\\ \\\\mathrm{mol}$ of nitrogen. The vessel is evacuated of all other gases. The ammonia is allowed to adsorb reversibly onto a monodisperse, activated silica surface ($A = 3.500\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}^2$) coating the vessel interior. The adsorption equilibrium at $T$ obeys the Langmuir isotherm:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\theta = \\\\frac{K_{L} P_{\\\\mathrm{NH_3}}}{1 + K_{L} P_{\\\\mathrm{NH_3}}}\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $\\\\theta$ is the fractional surface coverage and $P_{\\\\mathrm{NH_3}}$ is the gas-phase partial pressure of ammonia. The Langmuir constant is $K_L = 3.20 \\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$. The NH$_3$ monolayer occurs at $1.15 \\\\times 10^{18}$ sites·m$^{-2}$, each binding exactly one NH$_3$ molecule. Assume negligible multilayer formation and that nitrogen does not adsorb.\\n\\nAfter equilibrium, a rigid septum admits the entire headspace (all unadsorbed NH$_3$ and N$_2$) into a $1.000~\\\\mathrm{L}$ vessel containing $V_{aq} = 0.800\\\\ \\\\mathrm{L}$ H$_2$O and $n_{\\\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}} = 8.00 \\\\times 10^{-4}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{mol}$ of sulfuric acid. All contents rapidly reach $T = 298.15\\\\ \\\\mathrm{K}$. NH$_3$ partitions between the gas and water according to Henry's law:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nC_{\\\\mathrm{NH_3,aq}} = k_H\\\\, P_{\\\\mathrm{NH_3}}\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $k_H = 66.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{mol}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$ (at 298.15 K). N$_2$ does not dissolve appreciably. In water, dissolved ammonia ($\\\\mathrm{NH_3,aq}$) acts as a base and may react with added acid:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathrm{NH_3}~(aq) + \\\\mathrm{H_3O}^+~(aq) \\\\rightleftharpoons \\\\mathrm{NH_4}^+~(aq) + \\\\mathrm{H_2O}\\n\\\\]\\n$K_b = 1.78 \\\\times 10^{-5}$. The initial acid is fully dissociated; the final solution ionic strength $I$ is calculated as $I = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sum_i c_i z_i^2$ (where $c_i$ and $z_i$ are concentration and charge of ion $i$). The activity coefficient $\\\\gamma_i$ for ionic species is given by the Davies equation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\log_{10} \\\\gamma_i = -0.509 z_i^2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{I}}{1 + \\\\sqrt{I}} - 0.30 I \\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\nAssume the activities of neutral species and water are unity, and that volume changes due to gas dissolution are negligible.\\n\\nFinally, the solution is analyzed by UV absorption spectrophotometry at $\\\\lambda = 235\\\\ \\\\mathrm{nm}$, where $\\\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ has a molar absorptivity $\\\\varepsilon = 14.2\\\\ \\\\mathrm{L}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The 1.00-cm cuvette is filled with the full solution ($V_{aq} = 0.800~\\\\mathrm{L}$) and the transmission ($T$) is defined as $T = I/I_0$, where $I_0$ is the incident and $I$ is the transmitted intensity. Assume negligible absorption from all other species.\\n\\nCalculate the final transmission $T$ at $235~\\\\mathrm{nm}$ of the solution after all equilibria are established. Supply a single, final value in unitless decimal form (to 3 significant digits).\\n\\n**Constants:**\\n* $R = 8.314~\\\\mathrm{J\\\\,mol}^{-1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\\n* $1~\\\\mathrm{bar} = 10^5~\\\\mathrm{Pa}$\\n* $N_A = 6.022 \\\\times 10^{23}~\\\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\",\n",
