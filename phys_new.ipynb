The rod is hinged by a frictionless pivot at the point $\\\\mathcal{O} = (0,0,0)$ and is free to rotate in the $xz$-plane about the $y$-axis (i.e., the rod always lies along $z = s \\\\sin\\\\theta$, $x = s \\\\cos\\\\theta$, $y=0$ for $s \\\\in [0,L]$), where $\\\\theta$ is the angle measured from the positive $x$-axis toward $+z$. Throughout, the $z$-axis is vertically upward and gravity acts as $\\\\vec{g} = -g\\\\hat{z}$. The rod is fully submerged in a liquid of uniform mass density $\\\\rho_f = 1200\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, exerting buoyant force by Archimedes’ principle. The temperature and pressure of the fluid are uniform, and the entire system is in equilibrium at atmospheric pressure.\\n\\nA point charge $q = -100.0\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{C}$ is rigidly affixed to the free end of the rod at $s = L$, and an isolated external point charge $Q$ (magnitude and sign unknown) is held fixed at the location $\\\\vec{r}_Q = (2.00\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}, 0, 1.00\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m})$—that is, $x=2.00\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}$, $y=0$, $z=1.00\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}$—in vacuum just outside the fluid. The boundary at $z=0$ (the fluid’s lower surface) is a grounded, infinite, flat, perfect conductor such that any electrostatic field above is governed by Coulomb’s law in static equilibrium with the boundary condition that the electric potential vanishes at $z=0$ everywhere.\\n\\nNeglecting all viscosity, surface tension, polarization, and induced charges within the rod or fluid, assume:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n  \\\\item The entire rod lies at $y=0$ above $z=0$, i.e., $z(s) = s\\\\sin\\\\theta > 0$ for all $s \\\\in [0,L]$.\\n  \\\\item The only significant electrostatic forces arise between the charges $q$ and $Q$ (and their necessary image charges due to the conducting plane at $z=0$).\\n  \\\\item The mass of $q$ is negligible; all of the rod’s mass is distributed uniformly along its length.\\n  \\\\item There is no screening, permittivity enhancement, or plasma present: $\\\\varepsilon_r = 1$ and Debye screening can be neglected.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nWhen the system is at rest, the rod settles such that it forms an angle $\\\\theta = 45.0^{\\\\circ}$ (measured from the $x$-axis in the $xz$-plane as described above).\\n\\n\\\\textbf{Given:}\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n  \\\\item Gravitational acceleration: $g = 9.81\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\\n  \\\\item Vacuum permittivity: $\\\\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \\\\times 10^{-12}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{F}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\n\\\\textbf{Tasks:}\\n\\n(a) Derive, and numerically compute, the value (in $\\\\mathrm{\\\\mu C}$, to three significant digits) of the external point charge $Q$ required for static equilibrium at $\\\\theta = 45.0^\\\\circ$, accounting for all forces and torques acting on the rod (namely, gravity, buoyancy, and the electrostatic force including the image charge of $Q$ as imposed by the conducting plane at $z=0$).\\n\\n\\\\textbf{Give only the explicit numeric value (with correct SI units) for $Q$ required for equilibrium.}\",\n",
