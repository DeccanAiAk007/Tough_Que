    "feedback": "The problem\u2019s narrative leaves several key points ill-defined and internally inconsistent, which undermines later parts (b)\u2013(e).\n\n\u2022 Geometry/loop ambiguity: The \u201ccomplete conducting loop\u201d is said to run from A down the hemispherical bowl to the base, across the interior, and up to B, yet the bowl itself is simultaneously declared \u201cperfectly conducting.\u201d Unless the bowl is physically split at A\u2013B, this zero-resistance path would short\u2013circuit the R\u2081\u2225R\u2082 network, so essentially no power could ever be dissipated in the resistors (contradicting parts (c)\u2013(e)). Relatedly, the surface that bounds the magnetic flux is never specified with precision: is it the variable horizontal semicircle at the sphere\u2019s height, the fixed hemispherical metallic shell, or some composite surface that includes the resistors? The wording \u201csemicircular sector spanned \u2026 at the height of the sphere\u2019s center\u201d is especially vague\u2014its edge set, orientation, and electrical connection to the rest of the loop are not stated, yet its time derivative is required in (b).\n\n\u2022 Missing mechanical detail: The rolling-without-slip condition implies the center follows a circle of radius R_b \u2013 R_s, not R_b, but R_b alone is used to define the release height h; it is unclear whether the author means geometric height of the center or of the contact point, and the moment of inertia (2/5 mR_s\u00b2) is never introduced explicitly.\n\n\u2022 Flux variation mechanism: The magnetic field is uniform, static, and vertical; the bowl is fixed. For Faraday\u2019s law to yield a non-zero emf, the loop\u2019s *enclosed* area must change in time. However, only the *sphere* moves, not the conductors. The problem tacitly assumes that the electrical loop\u2019s lower boundary \u201crides\u201d with the sphere (hence the area is the horizontal semicircle whose radius depends on y), but this mobile contact is neither justified nor even mentioned. Without such a moving boundary, d\u03a6/dt = 0 and parts (c)\u2013(e) collapse.\n\n\u2022 Energy bookkeeping: Part (e) counts the electrical heat as available for melting ice but ignores the (large) work that must be supplied to return the sphere to the rim between runs; this hidden assumption of a perpetual, loss-free elevator is physically unrealistic.\n\n\u2022 Superfluous/unused data: The parallel combination R\u2081\u2225R\u2082 and B are never actually invoked unless the above flux issue is resolved; R_s is irrelevant to the flux expression yet is prominently given.\n\nTo salvage the question, the author must: (i) specify that the bowl is slit along AB so current must pass through R\u2081\u2225R\u2082, (ii) state that a sliding, perfectly conducting lead attached to the sphere forms the lower boundary of the loop, ensuring the enclosed horizontal semicircle shrinks as y decreases, (iii) clarify that h and y refer to the sphere\u2019s centre, and (iv) acknowledge the need for an external agent to reset the sphere or else omit part (e). Without these clarifications the later electromagnetic and thermal parts rest on undefined or contradictory premises.",
