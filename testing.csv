Assume the peak intensity is sufficient to induce non-perturbative harmonic generation, and that the generated third harmonic ($3\omega$) is detectable. Model the graphene as a two-band system with a linear dispersion relation $E(k) = \pm \hbar v_F |k|$, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $k$ is the wavevector. Assume that the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of graphene, $\chi^{(3)}(n)$, depends on the carrier density $n$ and saturates according to the following relation: $\chi^{(3)}(n) = \frac{\chi_0^{(3)}}{1 + (n/n_{sat})^2}$, where $\chi_0^{(3)}$ is the unsaturated third-order nonlinear susceptibility and $n_{sat}$ is the saturation carrier density. Assume the effective graphene thickness is $t$. Given that the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of graphene is given by the expression above, find the peak intensity of the third harmonic, $I_{3\omega}$, in terms of $I_0$, $\omega$, $t$, $\chi_0^{(3)}$, $n$, and $n_{sat}$. Assume that $I_{3\omega} = \frac{3\omega^2 |\chi^{(3)}|^2 I_0^3 t^2}{2 c^3 \epsilon_0^2}$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

"A new physics analysis submitted to HEPDATA reports evidence for a heavy neutral lepton (HNL) with mass $m_N = 400\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ and width $\Gamma = 20\,\mathrm{GeV}$, decaying into a muon and two jets ($\mu jj$), in data from a hypothetical LHC experiment at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The analysis selects events with an isolated muon, at least two jets, and significant missing transverse energy.

The signal region is defined by requiring the invariant mass of the $\mu jj$ system, $m_{\mu jj}$, to lie within $2\Gamma$ of the hypothesized HNL mass. That is,
$$
\left| m_{\mu jj} - m_N \right| < 2\Gamma.
$$

The observed number of events in the signal region is $N_{\mathrm{obs}} = 60$, and the expected background is $N_{\mathrm{bg}} = 45$. Assuming Poisson statistics, compute the one-sided $p$-value corresponding to the excess, and report the result as $-\log_{10}(\text{p-value})$.

"A neural network stores $p$ random patterns $\xi^{\mu}_i \in \{-1, +1\}$ ($\mu = 1, \dots, p$; $i = 1, \dots, N$) in $N$ neurons $S_i \in \{-1, +1\}$ via the learning rule $J_{ij} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\mu=1}^{p} f(\xi^{\mu}_i) f(\xi^{\mu}_j)$, where $f(x) = \text{sgn}(x + \epsilon x^3)$ and $\epsilon$ is a small constant. At temperature $T$, the network's dynamics are governed by Glauber dynamics with transition probabilities $W_i(S_i \to -S_i) = \frac{1}{2} [1 - S_i \tanh(\beta h_i)]$, where $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ and $h_i = \sum_{j=1}^{N} J_{ij} S_j$.  In the large-$N$ limit, with $p/N = \alpha$ finite, calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the local field $h_i$ for a retrieval state attempting to recall pattern $\xi^1$. Express the SNR to leading order in $\epsilon$ in terms of $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\epsilon$, and the overlap $m = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N S_i \xi^1_i$."
"In a study on Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM), a logistic regression model is developed to predict the probability of a poor neurological outcome. The model's log-odds (logit) score, $z$, is calculated using two biomarkers: the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio ($\mathrm{NLR}$) and the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) glucose level (in $\mathrm{mmol/L}$). 
Patient A has an $\mathrm{NLR}$ of $4.0$ and a CSF glucose level of $2.2\,\mathrm{mmol/L}$. Patient B has a more severe presentation with an $\mathrm{NLR}$ of $9.0$ and a CSF glucose level of $1.6\,\mathrm{mmol/L}$. Calculate the absolute increase in the probability of a poor outcome for Patient B compared to Patient A. "
"A novel drug delivery system is being designed using {[PBMI][BF][ClO]} as a carrier. The drug, a peptide with a molecular weight of $1000\,\mathrm{g \cdot mol^{-1}}$, is encapsulated within the HeDIL. The release of the peptide is triggered by thermal decomposition of the {[PBMI][BF][ClO]}. DSC analysis reveals a single-step exothermic decomposition with an onset temperature of $150^\circ\mathrm{C}$. It's found that $1\%$ (by weight) of the HeDIL decomposes per minute at $150^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The drug delivery system has a total initial mass of $10\,\mathrm{mg}$, comprising $99\%$ (by weight) of {[PBMI][BF][ClO]} and $1\%$ (by weight) of the peptide. Calculate the release rate of the peptide in $\mathrm{mol \cdot s^{-1}}$ at $150^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The molecular weight of {[PBMI][BF][ClO]} is $400\,\mathrm{g \cdot mol^{-1}}$."
"A researcher is investigating the regulatory network controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis during fruit ripening in $Vaccinium\ myrtillus$ (Bilberry) fruit. Through transcriptome analysis, a transcription factor $(TF)$ has been identified that significantly enhances the expression of multiple genes within the anthocyanin pathway. As the fruit progresses from green to the ripe stage, the expression of this $TF$ increases from $10 \text{ TPM}$ (Total Productive Maintenance) to $100 \text{ TPM}$ . Simultaneously, the rate of anthocyanin accumulation increases linearly from $0.1 \,\mathrm{\mu g/g \,FW/day}$ to $1\,  \mathrm{\mu g/g \,FW/day}$. Given that the rate of anthocyanin accumulation is assumed to be proportional to the square root of the $TF$ expression level, what would be projected rate of anthocyanin accumulation (in $\mathrm{\mu g/g \,FW/day}$) in a separate experiment where the $TF$ expression is artificially elevated to $400 \text{ TPM}$?

"A pharmaceutical company is formulating a DHA-loaded nanoemulsion for parenteral nutrition in neonates with severe liver dysfunction. DHA is known to degrade via both first-order hydrolysis \textit{and} enzymatic oxidation (zero-order), catalyzed by residual lipases in the PN admixture.

After mixing the nanoemulsion with a standard PN admixture, the final DHA concentration is $5\,\mathrm{mg/mL}$. Stability testing is performed. Data collected reveal DHA concentrations of $4.75\,\mathrm{mg/mL}$ after $6\,\mathrm{hours}$ and $4.52\,\mathrm{mg/mL}$ after $12\,\mathrm{hours}$ at a temperature of $4^\circ\,\mathrm{C}$.

Assuming that the enzymatic degradation rate is constant and follows zero-order kinetics, estimate the zero-order enzymatic degradation rate constant $k_0$ in $\mathrm{mg\,/\,(mL \cdot day)}$.
