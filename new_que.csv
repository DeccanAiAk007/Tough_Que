question
"A spacecraft is launched vertically upward from the surface ($z = 0$) of a spherically symmetric planet of radius $R_p = 6.00 \\\\times 10^{6}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}$ and mass $M_p = 6.00 \\\\times 10^{24}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg}$. The launch point is defined as $x = 0, \\\\ z = 0$, with the $+z$ axis radially outward from the planet's center. The planet is non-rotating; its gravitational field is purely central ($\\\\vec{g}(\\\\vec{r}) = -\\\\dfrac{G M_p}{r^2} \\\\hat{r}$ for $r = R_p + z$; $G = 6.67430 \\\\times 10^{-11}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}^3\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$). There is no atmosphere and no planetary rotation. \\n\\nThe spacecraft starts from rest with an initial total mass (including the capsule; see below) $M_0 = 2.80 \\\\times 10^5\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg}$ and burns fuel by expelling mass downward at constant exhaust speed $v_{\\\\mathrm{ex}} = 3.00 \\\\times 10^3\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m/s}$, providing a constant upward thrust $F_{\\\\mathrm{th}} = 4.00 \\\\times 10^6\\\\,\\\\mathrm{N}$ (magnitude and direction, always along $+z$). The only external force during ascent is gravity; the thrust vector always passes through the center of mass. The propellant flow rate is $\\\\dot{m} = -F_{\\\\mathrm{th}}/v_{\\\\mathrm{ex}}$ (constant in time). \\n\\nAt $z_{\\\\mathrm{sep}} = 2.50 \\\\times 10^5\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}$ altitude (i.e., height above the surface; so $r_{\\\\mathrm{sep}} = R_p + z_{\\\\mathrm{sep}}$), the rocket's total mass (including the capsule) has decreased to $M_{\\\\mathrm{sep}} = 1.40 \\\\times 10^5\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg}$. At this instant, a small escape capsule of mass $m_c = 4.00 \\\\times 10^3\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg}$ and net charge $Q = 3.00 \\\\times 10^3\\\\,\\\\mathrm{C}$ is instantaneously ejected upward along $+z$ (locally radially outward) from the hull at relative speed $u_0 = 150\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m/s}$ with respect to the center of mass of the remainder of the spacecraft. \\n\\nAssume: The quoted $M_{\\\\mathrm{sep}}$ includes the mass of the capsule immediately prior to separation. Immediately at separation, neglect any external impulses; the capsule and residual spacecraft move along $z$ with velocities $v_{z,\\\\mathrm{cap}}$ (capsule) and $v_{z,\\\\mathrm{sc}}$ (post-ejection main spacecraft) in the inertial planet frame. The total system momentum (in $z$) is conserved: \\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\nM_{\\\\mathrm{sep}} v_{\\\\mathrm{sep}} = m_c v_{z,\\\\mathrm{cap}} + (M_{\\\\mathrm{sep}} - m_c) v_{z,\\\\mathrm{sc}} \\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nwhere $v_{\\\\mathrm{sep}}$ is the vertical speed of the entire vehicle just before separation. The relative velocity of ejection is specified by\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\nv_{z,\\\\mathrm{cap}} - v_{z,\\\\mathrm{sc}} = u_0.\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nUsing these two equations, determine all necessary initial velocities.\\n\\nAfter separation, the capsule (treated as a point mass and point charge) is subject to:\\n(i) the planet's gravitational force $\\\\displaystyle \\\\vec{F}_g = -\\\\frac{G M_p m_c}{r^2} \\\\hat{r}$ with $r = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + (R_p + z)^2}$, acting toward the planet's center,\\n(ii) a uniform, constant electric field $\\\\vec{E}_0 = E_0 \\\\hat{z}$, $E_0 = 1.00 \\\\times 10^3\\\\,\\\\mathrm{V/m}$,\\n(iii) a uniform, constant magnetic field $\\\\vec{B}_0 = B_0 \\\\hat{y}$, $B_0 = 2.00 \\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{T}$.\\n\\nThroughout the capsule's trajectory, $\\\\vec{E}_0$ and $\\\\vec{B}_0$ are spatially uniform (unphysical over $>10^6$ m, but assume they persist everywhere without edge effects). Non-gravitational forces are always defined in reference to the $+x$ and $+z$ basis vectors, with electric field $E_0$ strictly along $+z$, and magnetic field $B_0$ strictly along $+y$. There is never any component along $x$ or $-z$.\\n\\nImmediately after ejection ($t=0$), the capsule's position is $x_0 = 0$, $z_0 = z_{\\\\mathrm{sep}}$, velocity components $(v_{x,0} = 0, \\\\ v_{z,0} = v_{z,\\\\mathrm{cap}})$ (all in the planet frame).\\n\\nThe capsule's equations of motion in the $x$-$z$ plane are:\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} &= \\\\frac{Q}{m_c} \\\\left( -\\\\frac{dz}{dt} B_0 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\[1em]\\n\\\\frac{d^2 z}{dt^2} &= \\\\frac{Q}{m_c}\\\\left( E_0 + \\\\frac{dx}{dt} B_0 \\\\right) - \\\\frac{G M_p (R_p + z)}{[x^2 + (R_p + z)^2]^{3/2}}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nwhere the $z$-component of gravity always points to the planet's center ($-\\\\hat{z}$ for $x=0$) and the Lorentz-force terms are correctly signed for $v_x \\\\hat{x}$ and $v_z \\\\hat{z}$ motions, $B_0$ along $\\\\hat{y}$.\\n\\nNeglect all forms of drag, radiation, relativistic, and rotational effects.

"A precision kinematics experiment is conducted on a perfectly horizontal track aligned with the laboratory $x$-axis. A cart moves strictly along $+x$ under a constant, uniform acceleration $a$ (with known mean $\\\\bar{a}$ and standard uncertainty $\\\\sigma_a$) from an initial position $x_0 = 0$ and starts from rest at $t=0$. The cart's deck defines the launch plane and is maintained at a fixed vertical height $H$ above a level, horizontal floor (both $H$ and its uncertainty $\\\\sigma_H$ are given). At measurement time $t_1$, determined by an electronic timer with value $\\\\bar{t}_1$ and standard uncertainty $\\\\sigma_{t_1}$, the cart's deck position is $x_1$. At $t_1$, a small spherical projectile is launched from rest relative to the cart deck at the deck's leading edge (the projectile's initial $z$-coordinate equals $H$; treat the size as negligible), with velocity components in the laboratory frame defined as follows:  \\n\\n- The launch velocity in the $x$-direction $u_x$ is the sum of the cart's instantaneous velocity at $t_1$ (i.e., $u_{\\\\text{cart}} = a t_1$) and a known relative velocity imparted by the launcher fixed to the cart, $u'_x$. Thus, $u_x = u_{\\\\text{cart}} + u'_x$. The sign convention is: $u'_x > 0$ when the projectile is launched forward (same direction as $+x$), $u'_x < 0$ if launched rearward relative to the cart.\\n- The vertical launch velocity $u_z$ (along the $z$-axis, positive upward) is given by $u'_z$.  \\n\\nThe vertical axis $z$ points up. The horizontal axis $x$ is along the floor. The projectile is modelled as a point mass, and air resistance is negligible. Local gravitational acceleration $g$ is downward (points $-z$), with known mean $\\\\bar{g}$ and standard uncertainty $\\\\sigma_g$. All uncertainties are independent and Gaussian.

The laboratory-frame projectile launch velocity is $u_x = a t_1 + u'_x$ (uncertainties properly propagated); the vertical velocity at launch is $u_z = u'_z$.\\n\\nDefine the *measured range* $R$ as the total horizontal distance between the projectile's landing point $x_2$ (where $z=0$) and its launch point $x_1$, i.e., $R = x_2 - x_1$.

The slab is initially at rest ($v_{\\\\text{slab}} = 0$). All collisions are perfectly elastic and restricted to one dimension.

"A solid hemisphere of radius $R$ and total mass $M$ is fabricated with a radially symmetric density profile $\\\\rho_s(r) = \\\\rho_{s,0} (1 + \\\\beta (r/R)^2)$, where $r$ is the distance from the symmetry axis and $\\\\beta$ is a constant. The hemisphere is fully submerged in a stationary, incompressible, uniform conducting fluid of density $\\\\rho_f$ and dynamic viscosity $\\\\eta$. The fluid contains free electrons of number density $n_e$ and the electron-neutral collision frequency is $\\\\nu_c$, so its (scalar) electrical conductivity is $\\\\sigma_f = n_e e^2 / (m_e \\\\nu_c)$, with $e$ the elementary charge and $m_e$ the electron mass. The flat face of the hemisphere rests on an infinite, frictionless, perfectly conducting horizontal plane at $z=0$, permitting the hemisphere to rotate freely about a horizontal axis (the $y$-axis) passing through a fixed point $P$ at the center of its base (i.e., the center of its flat face is the pivot).\\n\\nThe entire apparatus is centered within an external, uniform, time-invariant magnetic field $\\\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}$.

"Consider a solid cylindrical rod of high-purity aluminum, used as a moving bridge completing an electrical circuit between two parallel, perfectly conducting, fixed rails. The rails and rod are located in the equatorial plane at Schwarzschild coordinate radius $r$ in the spacetime of a nonrotating black hole of mass $M$. The rails are rigid, frictionless, non-expanding, and massless. The rod moves strictly radially inward under gravity. The electromagnetic environment is defined as follows: at the center of coordinates $(r=0)$, a stationary, axially symmetric, classical point magnetic dipole of moment $\\\\vec{\\\\mu}$ is aligned along the $z$-axis and does not vary over time. Assume that the Schwarzschild spacetime is weakly curved in the region $r_i \\\\gg r_s$, so that electromagnetic field formulas in local proper frames are valid, and redshift corrections only affect observable quantities as described below.\\n\\nThe rod at $r$ has proper length $L$, uniform radius $a$, and uniform mass density $\\\\rho_m$ (assume negligible mass-energy change from thermal expansion). At all times, the rod retains thermal, electrical, and mechanical equilibrium; Joule heating is the only non-gravitational energy transfer, and the rod loses energy only by isotropic black-body radiation into the vacuum. The rod and rails together form a closed circuit of total resistance $R(T)$ (rod only; rails and contact resistance are exactly zero) and fixed self-inductance $L_{\\\\mathrm{c}}$, explicitly given and independent of position or temperature. Thermal and electrical properties of aluminum are well approximated by $\\\\rho_e(T) = \\\\rho_{\\\\mathrm{res}}$ (temperature-independent) and $C_m(T) = C_{m,0}$ (also temperature-independent, neglecting quantum and phonon effects for these temperature and energy ranges), with all parameters below.\\n\\nThe circuit is oriented so that it encloses precisely the magnetic flux through a region of area $A(r)$ normal to the local $z$-direction, bounded by the two rails at constant $z$ and the moving rod at position $r$. The system starts at Schwarzschild coordinate radius $r = r_i$ with Schwarzschild coordinate velocity $v = dr/dt = 0$. When released at proper time $\\\\tau=0$, the rod falls radially inward, inducing a motional EMF $\\\\mathcal{E}_\\\\mathrm{prop}$ in its local proper frame, which drives a current $I(\\\\tau)$ governed by the relativistic R-L circuit law. The induced current produces a Lorentz force $F_B$, opposing the rod's motion. In the local proper frame at radius $r$, the equations of motion are:\\n\\n1. Relativistic energy conservation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{dE}{d\\\\tau} = - F_B \\\\left| v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}} \\\\right|,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $E$ is the rod's total energy as measured at infinity,\\n\\\\[\\nE(r, v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}) = \\\\frac{m_0 c^2}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\dfrac{r_s}{r} - \\\\dfrac{v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}^2}{c^2}}},\\n\\\\]\\nand $v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}$ is the local proper radial velocity.\\n\\n2. The motional EMF in the rod's proper frame is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathcal{E}_\\\\mathrm{prop}(r, v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}) = B_{z,\\\\mathrm{prop}}(r) \\\\, L \\\\, v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}},\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $B_{z,\\\\mathrm{prop}}(r)$ is the local $z$-component of the magnetic field from the dipole, evaluated at the rod location (using the flat-space dipole formula),\\n\\\\[\\nB_{z,\\\\mathrm{prop}}(r) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{4\\\\pi} \\\\frac{2 \\\\mu}{r^3}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\n3. The rod carries current $I(\\\\tau)$ from the R-L circuit law,\\n\\\\[\\nL_{\\\\mathrm{c}} \\\\frac{dI}{d\\\\tau} + R(T) I = \\\\mathcal{E}_\\\\mathrm{prop}(r, v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}).\\n\\\\]\\n\\n4. The braking Lorentz force (in the local rest frame) is\\n\\\\[\\nF_B(r, I) = I \\\\cdot L \\\\cdot B_{z,\\\\mathrm{prop}}(r).\\n\\\\]\\n\\n5. The rod's temperature $T(\\\\tau)$ evolves by energy balance,\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\left[m_0 C_{m,0}\\\\right] \\\\frac{dT}{d\\\\tau} = I^2 R(T) - \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\sigma_{SB} A_s T^4,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $A_s = 2\\\\pi a L + 2\\\\pi a^2$ is the total rod area.\\n\\n6. The rod experiences isotropic black-body cooling to the vacuum, with gravitational redshift correction: the effective radiative cooling power per proper time $P_{\\\\mathrm{cool}}$ is boosted in the local frame at radius $r$ by a factor $1/\\\\sqrt{1 - r_s/r}$ compared to power as measured at infinity, so emission is as in flat space in the local frame, and all calculations are carried out in the rod frame.\\n\\nPhysical and material parameters (exact for this problem):\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n&G = 6.674 \\\\times 10^{-11} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}^3/\\\\mathrm{kg}/\\\\mathrm{s}^2, \\\\\\\\\\n&c = 2.998 \\\\times 10^8 \\\\; \\\\mathrm{m/s}, \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\mu_0 = 4\\\\pi \\\\times 10^{-7} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{N/A}^2, \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\sigma_{SB} = 5.670 \\\\times 10^{-8} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{W}/\\\\mathrm{m}^2/\\\\mathrm{K}^4, \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\varepsilon_r = 0.09, \\\\quad L_{\\\\mathrm{c}} = 1.0 \\\\times 10^{-6}\\\\; \\\\mathrm{H}, \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\rho_m = 2700\\\\; \\\\mathrm{kg/m}^3, \\\\quad \\\\rho_{\\\\mathrm{res}} = 3.0 \\\\times 10^{-11}\\\\; \\\\Omega \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\\\\\\\n&M = 1.4 \\\\times 10^{31} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{kg}, \\\\quad \\\\mu = 2.5 \\\\times 10^{23} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{A} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{m}^2, \\\\\\\\\\n&L = 1.0\\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\quad a = 5.0 \\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\\\\\\\n&C_{m,0} = 900 \\\\; \\\\mathrm{J}/\\\\mathrm{kg}/\\\\mathrm{K}, \\\\\\\\\\n&R(T) = \\\\rho_{\\\\mathrm{res}} L/(\\\\pi a^2), \\\\quad A_s = 2\\\\pi a L + 2\\\\pi a^2, \\\\\\\\\\n&r_s = 2GM/c^2, \\\\quad r_i = 5.0\\\\times 10^5\\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\quad r_f = 9.0\\\\times 10^4\\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\\\\\\\n&m_0 = \\\\rho_m \\\\pi a^2 L, \\\\\\\\\\n&T(0) = 20.0\\\\; \\\\mathrm{K}, \\\\quad I(0) = 0.0\\\\; \\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\quad v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}(0) = 0.\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\n**Assumptions:**\\n- The rod's volume, mass, and area remain fixed; all expansion and contraction are ignored (\\\\( \\\\alpha_L = 0 \\\\)).\\n- The rod falls freely but is decelerated by the Lorentz force from the induced current; rail geometry does not change.\\n- The total resistance is precisely that of the rod; rails and contacts are ideal.\\n- The effects of quantum corrections, mechanical stress, and spacetime curvature on electromagnetic fields and emission are negligible for the radial range considered ($r_i \\\\gg r_s$).\\n- All quantities are evaluated in the rod's local proper frame, with all proper-time derivatives as shown; coordinate and proper times are related by $d\\\\tau/dt = \\\\sqrt{1 - r_s/r - v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}^2/c^2}$.\\n\\n\\n**Final Question:**\\n\\nCompute the total energy (in joules) dissipated as Joule heating in the rod during its entire fall from coordinate radius $r_i$ to $r_f$, that is,\\n\\\\[\\nQ_J = \\\\int_{\\\\tau=0}^{\\\\tau_f} I(\\\\tau)^2 R(T(\\\\tau)) \\\\, d\\\\tau, \\\\qquad \\\\text{where $r(\\\\tau_f) = r_f$}.\\n\\\\]\\nGive your answer in joules, rounded to three significant digits.\"
