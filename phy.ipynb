      "  \"question\": \"A cosmological probe deploys a detector on the surface of a non-rotating neutron star of mass $M_*$ and radius $R_*$, in Schwarzschild spacetime. The detector is a hollow right circular cylindrical calorimeter (length $L$, inner radius $R_1$, outer radius $R_2$) made of $m_\\\\text{cal}$ of Type-II superconducting niobium ($^{93}_{41}\\\\text{Nb}$). A static, externally generated magnetic field fills the bore $(R_1 \\\\leq r \\\\leq R_2)$ with field profile $\\\\mathbf{B}(r) = B_0 \\\\frac{R_1}{r} \\\\hat{\\\\phi}$ for $R_1 \\\\leq r \\\\leq R_2$, $0 \\\\leq z \\\\leq L$. The local dark matter is axions of rest mass $m_a$ and mass density $\\\\rho_a$, which resonantly convert to photons in the field, heating the calorimeter. \\n\\nThe energy deposited over the laboratory interval $\\\\Delta t_\\\\text{lab}$ is\\n\\\\[ \\nQ = \\\\mathcal{K}\\\\, \\\\frac{g_{a\\\\gamma\\\\gamma}^2\\\\,\\\\rho_a}{m_a}\\\\, \\\\Delta t_\\\\text{lab} \\\\int_V B^2(r)\\\\,dV_{\\\\text{prop}} \\n\\\\]\\nwhere $g_{a\\\\gamma\\\\gamma}$ is the axion-photon coupling, $\\\\mathcal{K}$ a known system constant, and $dV_{\\\\text{prop}}$ the proper volume element in Schwarzschild spacetime on the star's surface:\\n\\\\[\\ndV_{\\\\text{prop}} = \\\\alpha^2\\\\,2\\\\pi r\\\\,dr\\\\,dz\\\\hspace{4em} (\\\\alpha = \\\\sqrt{1-2GM_*/(c^2R_*)})\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis energy is measured as a temperature rise $\\\\Delta T$ in the niobium, so small that a linear heat-capacity approximation is valid. The niobium heat capacity per mole is\\n\\\\[\\nC_{V,m}(T, P_*) = \\\\gamma(P_*) T + \\\\beta(P_*) T^3\\n\\\\]\\nwith $\\\\gamma(P_*) = \\\\gamma_0 (1 - \\\\alpha_N P_*)$ and $\\\\beta(P_*) = \\\\beta_0 / [1 + \\\\alpha_\\\\Theta P_*]^3$.

The pressure $P_*$, assumed uniform and purely hydrostatic, is applied to *all* the niobium, and the pressure relationships are taken valid up to the given value.\\n\\nThe calorimeter is maintained initially at $T_0$, and is thermally connected to a SQUID readout whose Josephson frequency shift $\\\\Delta f_{\\\\text{obs}}$ is observed remotely over a proper time interval $\\\\Delta t_{\\\\text{obs}} \\\\gg \\\\Delta t_{\\\\text{lab}}$. The SQUID has a single Josephson junction of resistance $R_n$, critical current $I_c(T, P)$, and is biased near zero voltage. For an infinitesimal temperature change, the critical current varies as\\n\\\\[\\nI_c(T, P_*) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\,\\\\Delta(T,P_*)}{2eR_n}\\n\\\\]\\nwhere\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\Delta(T, P_*) = 1.764\\\\,k_B\\\\,T_c(P_*) (1+\\\\delta_{sc})\\\\sqrt{1 - (T/T_c(P_*))^2}\\n\\\\]\\nand the pressure-corrected critical temperature is\\n\\\\[\\nT_c(P_*) = T_c(0) [1 - \\\\alpha_P P_*]\\n\\\\]\\nParameters $T_c(0)$ and $\\\\delta_{sc}$ are given.

Its long axis (length $L_0$) is defined as the $x$-axis. The bar sits inside a long solenoid whose axis aligns with $x$; the interior magnetic flux density is uniform and parallel to $x$ at all times. The bar forms the resistive element in a series $LCR$ circuit, connected via ideal, thermally insulated leads. At $t=0$, a pre-charged capacitor of capacitance $C = 100 \\\\times 10^{-6}~\\\\rm{F}$ and voltage $V_0 = 2.00 \\\\times 10^4~\\\\rm{V}$ is switched into series with an inductor $L = 25 \\\\times 10^{-6}~\\\\rm{H}$ and the bar. The circuit current $I(t)$ is defined positive in the clockwise direction. At $t=0$, $I(0) = 0$. The apparatus operates in an evacuated, perfectly adiabatic enclosure; the entire bar is initially at uniform temperature $T_0 = 300~\\\\text{K}$. Throughout, the bar remains spatially uniform in temperature, field, and magnetization. Neglect mechanical vibration, gravity, and all forms of energy exchange except those explicitly described.

The fermions are maintained at a constant temperature $T = 0.100\\\\ \\\\mathrm{K}$ via weak coupling to an external thermal reservoir (the coupling is weak enough that the dynamics of the piston are not measurably affected). The upper compartment (above the piston) is evacuated.\\n\\nThe piston itself has mass $m_p = 2.00\\\\ \\\\mathrm{kg}$ and is acted upon by gravity ($g = 9.81\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m/s^2}$) and a viscous damping force $F_\\\\mathrm{damp} = -\\\\beta v_p$, with damping coefficient $\\\\beta = 0.100\\\\ \\\\mathrm{kg\\\\,s^{-1}}$ and $v_p$ the instantaneous velocity of the piston.\\n\\nAt $t = 0$, the system is in equilibrium: the height $h_0$ of the gas compartment is such that the total upward pressure force from the Fermi gas matches the downward force of gravity on the piston: $P_0 A = m_p g$, where $P_0$ is the equilibrium pressure and $A = \\\\pi R^2$ is the piston area. Assume the gas is highly degenerate, so the pressure at $T \\\\ll T_F$ can be approximated by $P = \\\\frac{(3\\\\pi^2)^{2/3}\\\\hbar^2}{5m_f} n^{5/3}$, where $n = N/V$ is the number density and $\\\\hbar = 1.05457 \\\\times 10^{-34}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{J\\\\,s}$.\\n\\nFor times $t > 0$, the entire apparatus is subject to a time-dependent vertical acceleration $a(t) = a_0 \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)$, with $a_0 = 1.50\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m\\\\,s^{-2}}$ and $\\\\omega = 10.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{rad\\\\,s^{-1}}$, in addition to gravity. That is, the apparent gravitational acceleration is $g_\\\\mathrm{eff}(t) = g - a(t)$. The system is operated for a long time and reaches a periodic dynamic steady state: the piston oscillates vertically about $h_0$ with a small amplitude $\\\\delta h \\\\ll h_0$, in response to the oscillatory $g_\\\\mathrm{eff}(t)$, entirely within the linear regime.

The system is in classical thermal equilibrium at absolute temperature $T = 300.0\\\\,\\\\mathrm{K}$. Friction is negligible, but the nanosphere is coupled to a heat bath by stochastic collisions so that its distribution over $\\\\theta$ in the laboratory frame is Boltzmann-like for the total energy including all inertial (centrifugal), mechanical potential, and electromagnetic effects. \\n\\nRelevant constants: Boltzmann constant $k_{\\\\mathrm{B}} = 1.3806 \\\\times 10^{-23}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{J/K}$, vacuum permittivity $\\\\epsilon_0 = 8.8542 \\\\times 10^{-12}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{F/m}$. \\n\\nAssume the following: (i) The nanosphere remains fixed relative to the hoop at every $\\\\theta$ as the hoop rotates, acquiring tangential velocity $\\\\mathbf{v}(\\\\theta)=\\\\Omega R\\\\left[\\\\sin \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\hat{x}-\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\hat{z}\\\\right]$ at each point. (ii) The total potential energy $U(\\\\theta)$ relevant for the Boltzmann distribution includes gravitational, centrifugal, electrostatic, and all velocity-dependent electromagnetic energy terms for a charged particle in a rotating frame. (iii) The electrostatic potential energy due to the charged wire is $U_{\\\\mathrm{wire}}(\\\\theta) = q V_{\\\\mathrm{wire}}(\\\\rho(\\\\theta))$ with $V_{\\\\mathrm{wire}}(\\\\rho) = (\\\\lambda/2\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0)\\\\ln(R_0/\\\\rho)$, where $R_0 = 1.000\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\\\rho(\\\\theta) = \\\\sqrt{R^2\\\\cos^2\\\\theta + R^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta} = R$ is the distance in the $xz$-plane from the wire at the origin. \\n\\nCalculate the thermal expectation value $\\\\langle z \\\\rangle$ of the vertical position of the nanosphere, where $\\\\displaystyle \\\\langle z \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} R \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\, e^{-U(\\\\theta)/k_{\\\\mathrm{B}}T}\\\\,d\\\\theta}{\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-U(\\\\theta)/k_{\\\\mathrm{B}}T}\\\\,d\\\\theta}$, accurate to three significant digits and expressed in SI units.\",\n",
