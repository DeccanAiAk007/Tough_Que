  "{\n  \"question\": \"A vertical, thermally and mechanically isolated cylindrical chamber of height $H = 1.00\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}$ and \\\\\\\\textbf{internal cross-sectional area} $A = 0.360\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}^2$ contains $n = 5.00$ moles of argon gas (molar mass $M = 39.95\\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg/mol}$, van der Waals constants $a = 1.355\\\\,\\\\mathrm{J\\\\,m}^3/\\\\mathrm{mol}^2$, $b = 3.211\\\\times 10^{-5}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}^3/\\\\mathrm{mol}$, and constant $C_{v,m} = 12.47\\\\,\\\\mathrm{J/(mol\\\\,K)}$). The \\\\\\\\textbf{entire top} of the chamber is sealed by a rigid, perfectly insulating plate. The \\\\\\\\textbf{bottom} of the chamber is a frictionless, massless, perfectly conducting \\\\\\\\textbf{movable piston} of area $A = 0.360\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}^2$, which faces atmospheric pressure $P_{\\\\mathrm{atm}} = 1.00\\\\times 10^5\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Pa}$ and is acted on by gravity ($g = 9.81\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m/s}^2$). (Assume the piston is perfectly gas-tight and is the only mobile boundary.)\\\\\\\\\\n\\nAffixed to the piston is the upper plate of a parallel-plate capacitor, with both plates of area $A$ and separated vertically by a variable gap $d$ (where $0 < d \\\\leq H$), so the bottom plate is always flush with the interior cylinder bottom. The capacitor plates are always parallel, horizontal, perfectly conducting, and occupy the entire cross-section of the cylinder (so the plates serve as both gas boundary and capacitor plates\u2014matching exactly the piston and chamber bottoms). The capacitor is connected at all times via ideal wires to a battery which maintains the potential difference $V_0 = 800.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{V}$. The capacitor is initially \\\\\\\\textbf{empty} (i.e., only gas is present; no dielectric), and the \\\\\\\\textbf{initial plate separation} is $d_i$.\\\\\\\\\\n\\nA thick, rigid dielectric slab of mass $m_s = 2.50\\\\ \\\\mathrm{kg}$, dimensions $A \\\\times d_s$ (where $d_s = d_i$ initially), dielectric constant $\\\\kappa = 6.0$, and specific heat $c_s = 1560\\\\ \\\\mathrm{J/(kg\\\\,K)}$, is suspended outside the system and initially held at the same temperature as the argon, $T_i = 300.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{K}$.\\\\\\\\\\n\\nThe system is perfectly insulated so no energy or matter enters or leaves the chamber at any stage. All relevant objects (piston, plates, and chamber walls) are massless and have zero heat capacity unless otherwise specified.\\\\\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\\\textbf{Process:} The battery maintains $V_0$ at all times. At $t=0$, the dielectric slab is gently inserted entirely vertically into the capacitor (between the plates) without touching the walls, so that it completely and snugly fills the plate gap (i.e., $d_f = d_s$ at the end, where $d_f$ is the final plate separation after all mechanical and thermal equilibration). The slab is lowered \\\\\\\\textbf{slowly from above} so that its weight is continuously supported by an external hand (so it acts as a constant-mass object, and its potential energy change is completely transferred to the rest of the system). Full mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic equilibrium is established in the final state.\\\\\\\\\\n\\nThe battery and the external hand supplying the slab each supply or absorb any energy; both remain at constant temperature (i.e., are infinitely large reservoirs for energy transfer). The only energy exchange allowed is work and electrical energy; no heat or mass leaves or enters the system.\\\\\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\\\textbf{Assume:}\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n    \\\\item The pressure on the gas is the force per unit area exerted on the piston by (i) the gas, (ii) atmospheric pressure outside (1 bar), (iii) the slab weight if present, and (iv) the electrostatic forces produced by the battery-driven capacitor (including the field energy and battery work).\\n    \\\\item The argon obeys the van der Waals equation: $\\\\left[P + a\\\\left( \\\\frac{n}{V} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right] (V - n b) = n R T$ ($R = 8.314\\\\,\\\\mathrm{J/(mol\\\\,K)}$). The relevant pressure $P$ is the mechanical pressure exerted by the gas on the moving piston.\\n    \\\\item The battery has negligible internal resistance: electrical energy delivered to the capacitor goes into field energy and/or is dissipated as heat in situ if required by the first law.\\n    \\\\item Dielectric slab, argon, chamber interior, and plates reach common final temperature $T_f$ after equilibration.\\n    \\\\item All energy transfers are quasi-static and reversible except for lossless mechanical coupling by the external hand.\\n    \\\\item Neglect edge/fringing effects (parallel plate approximation is accurate).\\n    \\\\item Ignore thermal expansion of the slab and any temperature dependence of $\\\\kappa$; the slab always fits snugly between the plates at $d_f$.\\n    \\\\item Heat capacity of argon and slab are both temperature-independent over the relevant range.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\n\\\\\\\\textbf{Given:}\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\nA &= 0.360\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}^2 \\\\\\\\nH &= 1.00\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m} \\\\\\\\nP_{\\\\mathrm{atm}} &= 1.00 \\\\times 10^5\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Pa} \\\\\\\\nV_0 &= 800.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{V} \\\\\\\\nd_i &= 0.0300\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m} \\\\\\\\nd_s &= 0.0300\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m} \\\\\\\\nm_s &= 2.50\\\\ \\\\mathrm{kg} \\\\\\\\n\\\\kappa &= 6.0 \\\\\\\\nc_s &= 1560\\\\ \\\\mathrm{J/(kg\\\\,K)} \\\\\\\\nM &= 39.95 \\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{kg/mol} \\\\\\\\na &= 1.355\\\\ \\\\mathrm{J\\\\,m}^3/\\\\mathrm{mol}^2 \\\\\\\\nb &= 3.211 \\\\times 10^{-5}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}^3/\\\\mathrm{mol} \\\\\\\\nC_{v,m} &= 12.47\\\\ \\\\mathrm{J/(mol\\\\,K)} \\\\\\\\nn &= 5.00 \\\\\\\\nT_i &= 300.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{K} \\\\\\\\ng &= 9.81\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m/s}^2\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\n\\\\\\\\textbf{Question:} After complete insertion of the slab and full equilibrium, \\\\\\\\textbf{what is the final common temperature $T_f$ (in K) of the argon-dielectric system?}\\\\\\\\\\n\\n(\\\\\\\\textit{Give your answer to three significant digits, boxed, together with appropriate SI units.

  "{\n  \"question\": \"A perfectly flexible uniform chain of total mass $m = 18.0~\\\\mathrm{kg}$ and length $L = 12.0~\\\\mathrm{m}$ rests fully coiled atop a frictionless platform of mass $M = 38.0~\\\\mathrm{kg}$ at initial height $H = 31.0~\\\\mathrm{m}$ above the ground. At time $t = 0$, the platform is released from rest and descends vertically under the action of gravity, but its downward acceleration is held constant at $a = 1.90~\\\\mathrm{m/s}^2$ by an external, precisely controlled mechanism. The platform's motion is not influenced by the changing load of the chain. As the platform descends, the chain unwraps at a constant rate (as measured in the ground frame): at any time $t$, the length of chain hanging straight down from the platform is $\\\\ell(t) = (L/T) t$, where $T$ is the total time required for the full chain to uncoil, and $\\\\ell(0) = 0$. The uncoiling rate $L/T$ is constant, and $T$ is explicitly given: $T = 4.00~\\\\mathrm{s}$. Assume the hanging chain always remains vertical, and neglect air resistance.\\n\\nAt time $t_1 = T/2 = 2.00~\\\\mathrm{s}$ (when exactly half the chain by length and mass is hanging), an ideal, instantaneous explosion splits the hanging portion exactly at its midpoint. Each resulting fragment, of mass $m/4$ and length $L/4$, receives an additional horizontal velocity $\\\\Delta v = 7.20~\\\\mathrm{m/s}$ in the $+x$ and $-x$ directions, respectively, in the ground frame, perpendicular to gravity. Immediately after the explosion, the remainder of the chain on the platform is fixed rigidly to it; the explosion exerts no impulse or recoil on the platform or the secured chain. The vertical velocities of all parts remain unchanged at the instant of the explosion.\\n\\nGiven $g = 9.81~\\\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, calculate the horizontal distance $\\\\Delta x$ in meters between the landing points of the two chain fragments on the ground.

  "{\n  \"question\": \"A solid homogeneous disk of mass $M = 6.20~\\\\mathrm{kg}$ and radius $R = 0.210~\\\\mathrm{m}$ is rigidly fixed to rotate frictionlessly on a horizontal axle through its center. A flexible, massless rope is wound $n=5$ times around the disk's perimeter, so that when the free end is pulled vertically downward by a compact mass $m = 1.30~\\\\mathrm{kg}$, the rope maintains taut contact and the disk rotates without slip. The system starts from rest, with the mass positioned $h = 3.00~\\\\mathrm{m}$ vertically above the ground. Neglect the mass of both rope and coil in all calculations.\\n\\nFirmly attached to the rope at a point immediately below the disk is a rigid rectangular copper coil with $N=1500$ identical turns, each of area $A=a b$ where $a=0.140~\\\\mathrm{m}$ and $b=0.070~\\\\mathrm{m}$.
