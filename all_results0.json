  "{\n  \"question\": \"Consider a solid cylindrical rod of high-purity aluminum, used as a moving bridge completing an electrical circuit between two parallel, perfectly conducting, fixed rails. The rails and rod are located in the equatorial plane at Schwarzschild coordinate radius $r$ in the spacetime of a nonrotating black hole of mass $M$. The rails are rigid, frictionless, non-expanding, and massless. The rod moves strictly radially inward under gravity. The electromagnetic environment is defined as follows: at the center of coordinates $(r=0)$, a stationary, axially symmetric, classical point magnetic dipole of moment $\\\\vec{\\\\mu}$ is aligned along the $z$-axis and does not vary over time. Assume that the Schwarzschild spacetime is weakly curved in the region $r_i \\\\gg r_s$, so that electromagnetic field formulas in local proper frames are valid, and redshift corrections only affect observable quantities as described below.\\n\\nThe rod at $r$ has proper length $L$, uniform radius $a$, and uniform mass density $\\\\rho_m$ (assume negligible mass-energy change from thermal expansion). At all times, the rod retains thermal, electrical, and mechanical equilibrium; Joule heating is the only non-gravitational energy transfer, and the rod loses energy only by isotropic black-body radiation into the vacuum. The rod and rails together form a closed circuit of total resistance $R(T)$ (rod only; rails and contact resistance are exactly zero) and fixed self-inductance $L_{\\\\mathrm{c}}$, explicitly given and independent of position or temperature. Thermal and electrical properties of aluminum are well approximated by $\\\\rho_e(T) = \\\\rho_{\\\\mathrm{res}}$ (temperature-independent) and $C_m(T) = C_{m,0}$ (also temperature-independent, neglecting quantum and phonon effects for these temperature and energy ranges), with all parameters below.\\n\\nThe circuit is oriented so that it encloses precisely the magnetic flux through a region of area $A(r)$ normal to the local $z$-direction, bounded by the two rails at constant $z$ and the moving rod at position $r$. The system starts at Schwarzschild coordinate radius $r = r_i$ with Schwarzschild coordinate velocity $v = dr/dt = 0$. When released at proper time $\\\\tau=0$, the rod falls radially inward, inducing a motional EMF $\\\\mathcal{E}_\\\\mathrm{prop}$ in its local proper frame, which drives a current $I(\\\\tau)$ governed by the relativistic R-L circuit law. The induced current produces a Lorentz force $F_B$, opposing the rod's motion. In the local proper frame at radius $r$, the equations of motion are:\\n\\n1. Relativistic energy conservation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{dE}{d\\\\tau} = - F_B \\\\left| v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}} \\\\right|,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $E$ is the rod's total energy as measured at infinity,\\n\\\\[\\nE(r, v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}) = \\\\frac{m_0 c^2}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\dfrac{r_s}{r} - \\\\dfrac{v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}^2}{c^2}}},\\n\\\\]\\nand $v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}$ is the local proper radial velocity.\\n\\n2. The motional EMF in the rod's proper frame is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathcal{E}_\\\\mathrm{prop}(r, v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}) = B_{z,\\\\mathrm{prop}}(r) \\\\, L \\\\, v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}},\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $B_{z,\\\\mathrm{prop}}(r)$ is the local $z$-component of the magnetic field from the dipole, evaluated at the rod location (using the flat-space dipole formula),\\n\\\\[\\nB_{z,\\\\mathrm{prop}}(r) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{4\\\\pi} \\\\frac{2 \\\\mu}{r^3}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\n3. The rod carries current $I(\\\\tau)$ from the R-L circuit law,\\n\\\\[\\nL_{\\\\mathrm{c}} \\\\frac{dI}{d\\\\tau} + R(T) I = \\\\mathcal{E}_\\\\mathrm{prop}(r, v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}).\\n\\\\]\\n\\n4. The braking Lorentz force (in the local rest frame) is\\n\\\\[\\nF_B(r, I) = I \\\\cdot L \\\\cdot B_{z,\\\\mathrm{prop}}(r).\\n\\\\]\\n\\n5. The rod's temperature $T(\\\\tau)$ evolves by energy balance,\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\left[m_0 C_{m,0}\\\\right] \\\\frac{dT}{d\\\\tau} = I^2 R(T) - \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\sigma_{SB} A_s T^4,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $A_s = 2\\\\pi a L + 2\\\\pi a^2$ is the total rod area.\\n\\n6. The rod experiences isotropic black-body cooling to the vacuum, with gravitational redshift correction: the effective radiative cooling power per proper time $P_{\\\\mathrm{cool}}$ is boosted in the local frame at radius $r$ by a factor $1/\\\\sqrt{1 - r_s/r}$ compared to power as measured at infinity, so emission is as in flat space in the local frame, and all calculations are carried out in the rod frame.\\n\\nPhysical and material parameters (exact for this problem):\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n&G = 6.674 \\\\times 10^{-11} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}^3/\\\\mathrm{kg}/\\\\mathrm{s}^2, \\\\\\\\\\n&c = 2.998 \\\\times 10^8 \\\\; \\\\mathrm{m/s}, \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\mu_0 = 4\\\\pi \\\\times 10^{-7} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{N/A}^2, \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\sigma_{SB} = 5.670 \\\\times 10^{-8} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{W}/\\\\mathrm{m}^2/\\\\mathrm{K}^4, \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\varepsilon_r = 0.09, \\\\quad L_{\\\\mathrm{c}} = 1.0 \\\\times 10^{-6}\\\\; \\\\mathrm{H}, \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\rho_m = 2700\\\\; \\\\mathrm{kg/m}^3, \\\\quad \\\\rho_{\\\\mathrm{res}} = 3.0 \\\\times 10^{-11}\\\\; \\\\Omega \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\\\\\\\n&M = 1.4 \\\\times 10^{31} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{kg}, \\\\quad \\\\mu = 2.5 \\\\times 10^{23} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{A} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{m}^2, \\\\\\\\\\n&L = 1.0\\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\quad a = 5.0 \\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\\\\\\\n&C_{m,0} = 900 \\\\; \\\\mathrm{J}/\\\\mathrm{kg}/\\\\mathrm{K}, \\\\\\\\\\n&R(T) = \\\\rho_{\\\\mathrm{res}} L/(\\\\pi a^2), \\\\quad A_s = 2\\\\pi a L + 2\\\\pi a^2, \\\\\\\\\\n&r_s = 2GM/c^2, \\\\quad r_i = 5.0\\\\times 10^5\\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\quad r_f = 9.0\\\\times 10^4\\\\; \\\\mathrm{m}, \\\\\\\\\\n&m_0 = \\\\rho_m \\\\pi a^2 L, \\\\\\\\\\n&T(0) = 20.0\\\\; \\\\mathrm{K}, \\\\quad I(0) = 0.0\\\\; \\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\quad v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}(0) = 0.\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\n**Assumptions:**\\n- The rod's volume, mass, and area remain fixed; all expansion and contraction are ignored (\\\\( \\\\alpha_L = 0 \\\\)).\\n- The rod falls freely but is decelerated by the Lorentz force from the induced current; rail geometry does not change.\\n- The total resistance is precisely that of the rod; rails and contacts are ideal.\\n- The effects of quantum corrections, mechanical stress, and spacetime curvature on electromagnetic fields and emission are negligible for the radial range considered ($r_i \\\\gg r_s$).\\n- All quantities are evaluated in the rod's local proper frame, with all proper-time derivatives as shown; coordinate and proper times are related by $d\\\\tau/dt = \\\\sqrt{1 - r_s/r - v_{\\\\mathrm{prop}}^2/c^2}$.\\n\\n\\n**Final Question:**\\n\\nCompute the total energy (in joules) dissipated as Joule heating in the rod during its entire fall from coordinate radius $r_i$ to $r_f$, that is,\\n\\\\[\\nQ_J = \\\\int_{\\\\tau=0}^{\\\\tau_f} I(\\\\tau)^2 R(T(\\\\tau)) \\\\, d\\\\tau, \\\\qquad \\\\text{where $r(\\\\tau_f) = r_f$}.\\n\\\\]\\nGive your answer in joules, rounded to three significant digits.\",\n  \"topic_tags\": [\n    \"General Relativity\",\n    \"Relativistic Electrodynamics\",\n    \"Thermodynamics\",\n    \"Computational Physics\"\n  ]\n}",
