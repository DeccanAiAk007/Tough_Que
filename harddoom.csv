"A spherical metallic particle is released from rest at the top (z=0) of a vertical tube of length H. The tube is filled with air (not a vacuum), in Earth's gravity g directed along +z (downward). The system parameters are:\n\n- Initial mass m_0, initial radius r_0, material density ρ (assume the particle remains solid, incompressible, and homogeneous at all times).\n- Ambient air density: ρ_air(z) = ρ_0 exp(–z/L), where L is a characteristic scale.\n- Ambient air viscosity: μ(T(z)) = μ_0 [T(z)/T_0]^δ, with μ_0, δ known.\n- Temperature profile: T(z) = T_0 – γ_T z, γ_T ≥ 0.\n- Upward air flow: u(z) = u_0 exp(–λz), λ > 0, u_0 ≥ 0.\n- The particle initially has electric charge Q_0, and is in external field E(z, t) = [E_0 + E_1 sin(ωt – ζz) – κz] ẑ.\n- Downward is +z. The particle’s instantaneous vertical position is z(t), velocity v(t).\n- The particle experiences: gravity, air buoyancy, electrostatic force, Stokes-like drag (with relativistic correction to order (v/c)^2), rotational drag, mass and charge loss by evaporation and emission, and thermophoretic force.\n- The particle rotates about its center with angular velocity ω_p(t), and its moment of inertia evolves as I(t) = (2/5) m(t) r(t)^2.\n\n**Evaporation and emission:**\n- Surface mass-loss per area: α(T) = α_0 [T(z)/T_0]^β.\n- Thermionic emission rate per area: ε(T) = ε_0 exp[–W/(k_B T(z))] (W = work function, k_B = Boltzmann constant).\n- Net mass-loss rate: dm/dt sum of both mechanisms.\n- Charge loss: dQ/dt = –η Q r^2 – ν [E(z, t)]^m Q (surface and field emission).\n\n**Thermophoresis:**\n- Force: F_th = θ r T(z) (dT/dz), θ constant.\n\n**Dragging and rotation:**\n- Drag on translation: F_drag = 6πμ(T(z)) r (v_rel) × [1 + (9/16)(v_rel/c)^2], with v_rel = v – u(z), c = light speed. (The relativistic factor is strictly to O[(v/c)^2]).\n- Rotational drag: torque τ_drag = –8πμ(T(z)) r^3 ω_p.\n\nBoundary and initial conditions:\n- At t=0: z=0, v=0, m=m_0, r=r_0, Q=Q_0, ω_p=ω_{p0}.\n- Particle is lost if m=0 or r=0 before reaching z=H (define t_f as the first of z(t_f)=H, m(t_f)=0, or r(t_f)=0).\n- No wall or end effects. Ignore effect of radiation pressure. Assume evaporation and emission affect only the surface (do not change bulk density ρ).\n\n**Questions:**\n(a) Explicitly write, with all variable and parameter dependencies, the coupled system of equations governing z(t), v(t), m(t), Q(t), r(t) and ω_p(t), including the mass/charge histories as integral–differential equations. Take care with all units, and carefully justify each term and the sign conventions.\n\n(b) Derive, to O[(v/c)^2], an implicit integral relation for the time t_f taken for the particle to reach z=H, including all variable dependencies. Discuss limiting behaviors as γ_T → 0 (isothermal), E_1 → 0 (static field), and u_0 → 0 (stationary air).\n\n(c) In the special case α_0 ≠ 0, all other loss/field/rotation parameters zero (i.e., pure isothermal evaporation at T_0), derive explicit analytic solutions (as functions of t) for r(t), v(t), and Q(t), and obtain a closed-form for the total time t_f,evap to full evaporation. Graph qualitatively the time evolution of r(t), v(t), Q(t) over the descent.\n\n(d) At mid-depth z=H/2 and time t=τ, suppose E_1 and ζ are chosen so the net Lorentz force (Q E) is exactly canceled by the sum of drag and thermophoretic force at that instant (ignore gravity and buoyancy at this step). Express the required E_1 (symbolically) in terms of Q(τ), r(τ), v(τ), τ, H, and all relevant parameters evaluated at z=H/2 and t=τ. State clearly any assumptions used."
"A uniform cylindrical rod of radius a and length L (mass density ρ_0), is suspended vertically, coaxially, at rest within a much larger stationary cylindrical vat (inner radius R ≫ a, height H_vat) filled with water (density ρ_w, dynamic viscosity η) to height h_w < H_vat. The lower end of the rod hangs at height d above the vat bottom (0 < d < h_w - L), so the rod is entirely immersed (detailed boundary layers may be ignored). An external mechanism imposes a time-dependent vertical acceleration on the entire vat–rod–water system: a_ext(t) = a_0 cos(Ω t), upward, as measured relative to the lab. Simultaneously, the vat is rotated about its axis at constant angular speed ω, but the rod remains nonrotating due to a torsionally stiff suspension. Gravity points downward with acceleration g. The water is isothermal at temperature T_0; its density is constant (incompressible, neglecting all thermal expansion or compressibility). Atmospheric pressure P_0 acts on the free water surface. Viscous effects are negligible (assume the water's angular velocity field is everywhere Ω_w(r) = ω, i.e., the high-Reynolds regime with no velocity shear at the rod or wall). Assume the rod is perfectly rigid and homogeneous.\n\n(a) Derive an explicit expression for the instantaneous net upward buoyant force F_b(t) experienced by the rod, including all hydrostatic pressure gradients arising from gravity, acceleration a_ext(t), and centrifugal effects from vat rotation. Use a consistent cylindrical (r, φ, z) system with z measured upward from the vat bottom, and keep all steps explicit. State your sign conventions clearly, and explain how the total effective gravity vector determines the pressure field.\n\n(b) The lower half of the rod (z in [d, d+L/2]) is painted with a chemical that imparts a surface magnetic susceptibility χ_s (SI, dimensionless per unit area) only to that region. A uniform vertical magnetic field B = B_0 ẑ is then applied. Calculate the total vertical force F_mag exxerted by the field on the painted part of the rod (neglect edge effects and self-demagnetization). Express your answer in terms of the given parameters (a, L, d, χ_s, B_0, μ_0).\n\n(c) In a separate experiment, two samples (sample A and B), each containing n moles of a real gas (molar mass M), are kept at the same temperature T_1 but at different volumes V_A and V_B and initial pressures P_A and P_B. The gases are mixed reversibly and isothermally (at T_1) in a thermally insulated, rigid container (total final volume V = V_A + V_B), with no exchange of PV work or heat with surroundings (except that needed to maintain T_1). The gas obeys the van der Waals equation with known parameters a_vdw and b_vdw. Calculate (i) the total change in entropy ΔS_mix upon mixing, (ii) the final pressure P_f of the gas, and (iii) the total change in internal energy ΔU during mixing. Provide explicit integrals or formulas, and briefly state any further assumptions you must make."
"A bead of mass m, modeled as a point particle (no rolling or rotational degrees of freedom), slides without slipping on a perfectly rigid, smoothly fixed circular wire loop of radius R that lies in the vertical xz-plane (centered at the origin, axis along the y-direction). Gravity acts downward along the negative z-direction. The bead remains in contact with the loop at all times (the normal force is always non-negative). The loop is rigidly affixed inside an elevator that moves only along the z-axis, undergoing a vertical acceleration a_e(t) = a₀⋅sin(Ω t), where a₀ and Ω are positive real constants; the elevator's vertical position is otherwise arbitrary. This means the effective gravitational field in the elevator is g′(t) = g – a_e(t), where g is the acceleration due to gravity. At all times, g′(t) points down in the –z direction.\n\nThe loop is additionally made to rotate at a (possibly time-dependent) angular velocity ω(t) about its axis (the y-axis through the center of the loop). For the remainder of the problem, take ω(t) = ω₀ + ξ sin(Λ t), with ω₀ > 0, ξ ≥ 0, and Λ > 0 all given constants. Thus, dω/dt = ξΛ cos(Λ t) is generally nonzero and must be included in any non-inertial force analysis.\n\nLet θ denote the instantaneous polar angle of the bead in the xz-plane, measured from the bottommost point (z_min), such that θ=0 is directly below the loop center (z = –R), θ=π/2 is at the frontmost point (x = +R), θ=π is the topmost point (z = +R), and θ increases in the counterclockwise direction as viewed looking along the +y axis.\n\nThe bead is subjected to kinetic friction with a coefficient μ_k(θ, t, v) = μ₀·[1 + α sin(θ) cos(Ω t) + β v²], where μ₀ > 0, α and β are real dimensionless constants (with |α| < 1 to ensure μ_k > 0 always), and v is the instantaneous speed of the bead measured along the arc. The friction force is taken to be F_fric = –μ_k N sgn(v), directed opposite to the velocity at all times. Here, N(θ, t, v) is the normal reaction force exerted by the loop on the bead (expressions to be derived). There is no air resistance. Assume all parameters (m, R, g, a₀, Ω, μ₀, α, β, ω₀, ξ, Λ) are known and specified.\n\n(a) Write an explicit, fully detailed expression for the net tangential force F_tan(θ, t, v) acting on the bead in the instantaneous non-inertial reference frame co-rotating with the loop y-axis at angular speed ω(t) and vertically comoving with the elevator. List and derive all tangential force contributions, including (i) the component of effective gravity g'(t) tangent to the loop at θ, (ii) centrifugal force due to rotation, (iii) Euler (transient rotation) force, (iv) Coriolis force, and (v) kinetic friction, with all geometric projections worked out in terms of θ, t, v, and the given parameters. Show how each inertial term arises and specify which terms vanish at v = 0.\n\n(b) Write the full nonlinear second-order differential equation governing θ(t) for the bead’s motion subject to the above forces, in explicit form: m R θ¨ = F_tan(θ, t, θ˙). Carefully display all dependencies, grouping terms as functions of θ, t, and θ˙. State all initial conditions: at t = 0, θ = 0 (bottom), θ˙ = ε ≪ 1 (small positive) so the bead starts moving counterclockwise.\n\n(c) For a specific time t₁ > 0, define θ₁ as the first value θ₁ > 0 for which the bead momentarily comes to rest (i.e., θ˙(t₁) = 0 with θ(t₁) = θ₁ and θ₁ < π). Write the transcendental equation that must be satisfied by θ₁, integrating the equation of motion (energy or work approach permitted) and explicitly indicate all dependences on θ₁, t₁, and the parameters. Outline a practical root-finding algorithm (e.g., bisection, Newton–Raphson) to determine θ₁ given parameter values.\n\n(d) Derive an exact integral expression for the total work W_f dissipated by friction as the bead travels from θ = 0 to θ₁, in terms of the arc-length, kinetic friction dependence μ_k(θ, t, v), and the normal reaction N(θ, t, v). Express W_f as an integral over θ (from 0 to θ₁), where v = v(θ) and t = t(θ) are determined from the solution of the ODE. Suggest a numerical quadrature strategy for evaluating W_f given trial functions t(θ) and v(θ).\n\n(e) Discuss qualitatively (with equations and sketches as needed) the conditions for (i) mono-stability versus multi-stability (number of possible stopping points θ₁ in 0 < θ < π) as a function of α, β, μ₀, ω₀, a₀, ξ, and Λ; (ii) how the parametric driving in the elevator acceleration a_e(t) and loop rotation ω(t) can induce bifurcation or resonance phenomena (i.e., multiple θ₁’s or none at all for certain parameter regimes, or sensitive dependence on initial conditions); and (iii) the general impact of the time-dependent inertial couplings on dissipative dynamics from a non-equilibrium statistical perspective."
"A vertical cylindrical chamber of internal height H and fixed cross-sectional area A contains n moles of a monatomic ideal gas (molecular mass μ, with C_v = (3/2)R). The cylinder is closed at the bottom and at the top by a perfectly smooth, finite-mass piston of mass m_p that fits tightly but moves without friction. Above the piston is vacuum; below it, only the gas. The chamber sits at rest on the surface of a planet with uniform gravity g (constant, downward). The system is thermally insulated except as described below. At time t = 0, the system is in equilibrium: the gas is at temperature T_0 and pressure P_0, the piston is held at height h_0 (distance from cylinder bottom to piston underside), and the gas volume is V_0 = A h_0. \n\nAt t = 0, a solid point mass m (distinct from m_p) is gently placed upon the piston and instantly comes to rest, bringing the total mass above the gas to (m_p + m). The mass is placed quasi-statically so that negligible mechanical energy is transferred to the gas during placement (i.e., the gas state remains unchanged at this instant). Then, the piston is suddenly released and allowed to move, now subject to gravity and the force from the gas below. Neglect all friction and assume the cylinder is infinitely rigid.\n\nThe system rapidly equilibrates: the piston descends (quasi-statically), compressing the gas adiabatically as it seeks a new equilibrium position. After the piston comes to rest, it is held in place. Immediately after, the gas is placed in perfect thermal contact (via a switchable, perfectly conducting rod) with a large internal radiation cavity of volume V_c, previously evacuated and at 0 K. The cavity is perfectly black and initially contains no radiation. The combined gas + piston + mass + cavity system is perfectly insulated from the outside, and only exchanges energy internally. The cavity reaches thermal equilibrium with the gas; all exchanged energy stays within the chamber+cavity system.\n\nFor this protocol:\n\n(a) Calculate, in terms of system parameters (n, μ, m_p, m, A, h_0, V_c, T_0, g, and any necessary universal constants), the final equilibrium temperature T_f and pressure P_f of the gas after (i) the piston has settled under the added load (before thermal equilibration with the cavity), and (ii) after complete thermodynamic equilibrium is reached between the gas and any photons in the cavity. Assume the gas is ideal and monatomic at all densities.\n\n(b) If in step (ii) the gas density is such that it enters the quantum degenerate regime and is well-approximated as an ideal spin-½ Fermi gas at low temperature (μ and n given), calculate quantitatively (i) the Fermi temperature T_F and (ii) the modified final equilibrium temperature T_f' after thermalization with the photon cavity, assuming total energy is conserved and the Fermi gas still exchanges only energy (not particles) with the photon field. Express T_f' and equilibrium pressure P_f' in terms of system and physical constants.\n\nAll steps and derivations must be shown. Explicitly state all assumptions, and specify the reference frame in all energy calculations."
"A solid spherical particle of radius r and total mass m, comprised of material with radially varying density ρ(r') = ρ₀[1 + α(r'/r)^p], is placed inside a rigid hemispherical bowl of inner radius R (R ≫ r), whose symmetry axis is aligned vertically (z-axis pointing upward). The bowl rotates at constant angular speed ω about the vertical axis in a laboratory frame. Gravity acts downward (−ẑ), and the lowest point of the bowl corresponds to θ = 0. The polar coordinate θ ∈ [0, π/2] measures the angle from the vertical axis at the bowl's center (θ = 0 at the bottom, θ increasing upward). The bowl’s interior is coated with a thin film of non-Newtonian oil with the following properties:\n\n- Rheology: oil is a compressible, shear-thinning fluid, with dynamic viscosity η = η₀[1 + χ|du/dz|^{-s}]^{-1}, (η₀ > 0, χ > 0, s > 0), negligible static shear modulus.\n- Compressibility: under excess local pressure ΔP, the local oil thickness changes according to t(θ) = t₀ + βΔP(θ), where t₀ is the undeformed thickness and β is the (small) compressibility parameter.\n\nThe ambient atmosphere (for hemispherical z > 0) is an ideal gas at pressure P₀ and temperature T. The pressure above the oil/bowl is continuous with the atmosphere, but centrifugal forces (due to both oil and particle) can induce pressure gradients (neglecting surface tension).\n\nThe particle locally deforms the oil film where it contacts it (around θ₁), displacing oil and producing an excess pressure ΔP₁ beneath it (maximum at θ₁), while the oil supports only minimal elastic response (no standing elastic modes). The mechanical contact area is small, but rolling friction (due to viscous shear in the oil) exists. The particle rolls with negligible slip as long as the static friction criterion is met; otherwise, partial slip incurs energy dissipation.\n\nA coherent, monochromatic, collimated laser beam of known intensity I and wavelength λ (with small but finite bandwidth Δλ ≪ λ), strikes the bowl obliquely at incident angle φ (defined with respect to the local oil normal), from the azimuthal direction φ̂ at fixed θ = θ_L. The incident linear polarization is along the x̂ direction in the lab frame. The oil’s refractive index n(θ, t) is a scalar (the oil is optically isotropic except for local field effects): n(θ, t) = n₀ + σ_E|E_{ext}(θ,t)|², where σ_E is the Kerr coefficient and E_{ext}(θ, t) is the externally applied in-plane electric field at position θ, time t. An AC electric field is applied in the θ̂ direction everywhere in the bowl: E_{ext}(θ,t) = E₀ sin(Ωt).\n\nThe total mass m of the particle is determined by m = 4πρ₀r³/3·[1 + 3α/(p+3)], i.e., for given (r, ρ₀, α, p). The density ρ₀, structural parameter α, and exponent p are all positive and prescribed.\n\nAdditional physical data and assumptions:\n- The oil film is thin (t(θ) ≪ r ≪ R), with gentle angular variation and no rupture.\n- The bowl is perfectly rigid and fixed in radius R, with negligible vibrational response.\n- All surfaces are smooth; capillarity and surface-tension effects are negligibly small (Bond number ≫ 1).\n- Thermal gradients and thermocapillary currents are negligible relative to the dominant viscous, centrifugal, and gravitational forces.\n- The influence of the AC electric field on oil viscosity is neglected (no electrostriction), only n(θ, t) is modulated.\n- The pressure in the oil at θ, ΔP(θ), is governed by the local static force balance (gravitational, centrifugal, and atmospheric contributions), and the additional load from the particle if present.\n\n(a) Write explicit expressions for:\n  (i) The local force components (at θ₁) acting tangentially to the bowl surface on the particle (resolve into θ̂ and φ̂ at θ₁), including gravity, centrifugal, normal reaction, viscous rolling resistance, and optical radiation pressure from the laser, using the coordinate system described. State all assumptions and approximations. (ii) The normal (radial) equilibrium condition at θ₁ for the particle, relating the local oil pressure ΔP₁, bowl curvature, and contact area. (iii) The critical static friction constraint for rolling without slip at θ₁, derived from oil rheology and normal force. Neglect Coriolis and surface tension forces, but treat the oil as compressible and shear-thinning as above.\n\n(b) Derive, using Maxwell’s equations for a scalar, time-dependent refractive index n(θ, t), the generalized interference condition for constructive reflection from the air/oil/bowl structure at θ = θ_L, incorporating:\n  - The spatial variation of oil thickness t(θ_L) due to deformation from ΔP(θ_L),\n  - Modulation of n(θ_L, t) from the applied AC electric field, averaged over one full cycle,\n  - The non-normal angle of incidence φ,\n  - The finite spectral coherence (Δλ ≪ λ),\nExpress the m_int-th constructive maximum as a function of these parameters.\n\n(c) For a specified set of parameters (m, r, R, ω, P₀, t₀, β, n₀, σ_E, E₀, Ω, η₀, χ, s, α, p, ρ₀, I, λ, Δλ, φ, θ₁, θ_L, T), compute numerically:\n  (i) The equilibrium angle θ₁(ω) attained by the particle, and the corresponding local excess pressure ΔP₁ under the particle, assuming equilibrium in the θ̂ direction and provided atmospheric compressibility (use ideal gas law) as a correction to P₀ if needed.\n  (ii) The modified local oil thickness t₁' = t₀ + βΔP₁ at θ₁, and the resulting spectral shift (Δλ_eff) in the position of the m_int-th constructive interference maximum at θ_L nearby (assume small m_int).\n  (iii) Assess under what conditions (in ω, E₀, T) the equilibrium at θ₁ becomes bistable or unstable due to frictional or compressibility effects, and discuss qualitatively how fluctuations in ambient temperature and pressure affect the mechanical and optical equilibrium.\n\nUse only parameters and relationships appearing explicitly above; if any closure equations (e.g., relating ΔP₁ to local loading, or t(θ) to pressure) are needed, state them fully."
"A finite dielectric slab of mass m_S, thickness h, and cross-sectional area A moves strictly along the z-axis between two perfectly conducting, infinite, parallel plates separated by distance d (h < d). The system sits in vacuum at temperature T > 0 (finite but possibly low), eliminating all material baths. The laboratory frame is inertial and non-rotating. The slab dynamics consist only of z-axis center-of-mass position z_S(t), subject to no-slip boundary conditions at plates (z=0, z=d) but otherwise unconstrained along z, with z_S(0) = 0 and z_S(T) = z_0 (0 < z_0 < d). The environment is quantum: the slab is described by quantum mechanics, but all measurable fields and noise sources are operator-valued and all averages correspond to quantum statistical averages (Tr[ρ ...]) at temperature T.\n\nAn applied voltage V(t) = V_0 e^{-α t} cos(β t) + ξ(t) creates an electric field E(z, t), with ξ(t) a classical telegraph noise process switching randomly between ±V_n at rate γ_n. The slab is a homogeneous, quantum paraelectric: its scalar permittivity ε_r is a quantum operator with stationary mean ⟨ε_r⟩ and time-dependent fluctuations δε_r(t), where δε_r(t) are Gaussian, stationary, and characterized fully by autocorrelation function K_ε(t-t'). All voltage and permittivity noise sources, including ξ(t) and δε_r(t), are mutually uncorrelated (cross-correlations vanish).\n\nThe sole dissipative channel is quantum electromagnetic decoherence, represented by an operator-valued current J_decoh(t), whose anticommutator autocorrelation ⟨{J_decoh(t), J_decoh(t')} / 2⟩ = K_J(t-t'), with no further dissipative or thermal baths.\n\nThe total Hamiltonian is specified as H_tot = H_free(z_S, p_S) + H_field + H_int, with (i) slab center-of-mass free Hamiltonian H_free = p_S^2 / (2 m_S), (ii) quantized field–slab interaction H_int coupling electromagnetic field E(z, t), quantum ε_r, and J_decoh(t) through standard electrodynamic and quantum dissipative terms (full expressions provided), and (iii) field energy H_field accounting for both fluctuating Maxwell and quantum noise contributions.\n\nDefine the total external work W_ext done on the slab during motion (from t=0 to t=T) as the time-integral of the force acting via the Maxwell stress tensor (including full quantum field and slab ε_r(t) fluctuations) plus work performed by J_decoh(t). The field-slab system is otherwise isolated: all other exchanges are forbidden, and all parameters (A, h, d, m_S, V_0, α, β, V_n, γ_n, ⟨ε_r⟩, K_ε, K_J, T) are precisely specified and time-independent except as noted.\n\n(A) Write explicitly the operator-valued, stochastic Langevin equation governing z_S(t), capturing forces from the quantized electromagnetic field (with time-dependent quantum permittivity ε̂_r(t) and externally applied voltage including telegraph noise), as well as the dissipative operator current Ĵ_decoh(t). State all non-zero noise and field correlation functions used.\n\n(B) Using the quantum Keldysh path integral framework, formulate the exact expression for the probability distribution functional P[{z_S(t)}] for the trajectory z_S(t) over [0, T], retaining all memory kernels and autocorrelations (but no cross-correlations). Specify how the MSR path integral reduces to the quantum Keldysh action in this context.\n\n(C) Derive, in closed form, the characteristic function (moment-generating functional) χ(λ) = ⟨e^{iλ W_ext}⟩ for the total external work, showing dependence on autocorrelation spectra K_ε(ω), K_J(ω), and the telegraph process parameters. Explain how to obtain the nth cumulant ⟨W_ext^n⟩_c from χ(λ).\n\n(D) State the quantum fluctuation theorem (Crooks or Jarzynski identity) applicable to this system, given the presence of a classical telegraph process ξ(t) and quantum decoherence channel J_decoh(t). Analyze under what conditions (e.g. in the limit γ_n → 0, or J_decoh → 0) detailed balance or microreversibility is restored, and state the precise ensemble average relevant for the theorem. If a generalized form is required due to breakdown of microreversibility, provide the correct generalized statement."
"A straight copper rod of initial (reference) length L₀ and uniform circular cross-sectional area A₀ is mounted radially within a rotating toroidal space habitat. The rod's left end (material coordinate X = 0) is rigidly clamped to the habitat's inner wall at radius R₁, and the right end (X = L₀) extends outward to R₂ = R₁ + L₀ (define R₁ ≫ L₀; for instance, R₁ = 100 m, L₀ = 1 m). The axis of rotation is the z-axis; the torus lies in the x–y plane. The system rotates at constant angular velocity ω about the z-axis (ω = 10 rad/s). Adopt a right-handed Cartesian frame with origin at the rotation axis; the rod is positioned radially along the x-direction (so the rod's undeformed central axis coincides with the local radial axis; i.e., X increases with radius along +x̂). \n\nThe rod is subject to a prescribed, time-varying axially symmetric temperature gradient: at time t, the temperature field is T(X, t), with T(0, t) = T₀ and T(L₀, t) = T₁(t), where T₀ is a fixed reference temperature and T₁(t) is a known, smooth function (\nfor instance, T₁(t) = T₀ + ΔT·sin(Ω t) with ΔT up to 500 K, Ω = 2π × 1000 Hz).\n\nA spatially inhomogeneous but axisymmetric magnetic field is externally imposed in the rotating frame: at any time t, B⃗ (r, t) = B₀(t) · f(r) · ŷ, where ŷ is the laboratory-frame Cartesian axis perpendicular to the rod, B₀(t) is a prescribed arbitrary (possibly rapidly time-varying) amplitude, and f(r) varies smoothly with radius such that ∇·B⃗ = 0 throughout the region containing the rod and B⃗ remains finite. For example, f(r) = 1 − (r − R₁)/L₀ for R₁ ≤ r ≤ R₂. The electric field, current, and all other electromagnetic fields are defined with respect to this Cartesian frame.\n\nAssume all physical quantities follow the following conventions:\n• The local material coordinate is X ∈ [0, L₀] in the reference configuration; current (deformed) position is x(X, t).\n• All fields (temperature T, axial displacement u, stress σ, electric field E, current density J, etc.) are defined as functions of (X, t) unless otherwise stated.\n• The rod is thin (A₀/L₀ ≪ 1) and undergoes negligible transverse displacements (remain in 1-D), but longitudinal strains may be large (finite strain), and inelastic deformation (plasticity) is possible when stress exceeds the yield stress σ_Y(T).\n• Electrical and thermal conductivities, Young's modulus Y, and linear thermal expansion coefficient α are given by explicit smooth functions of temperature (e.g., Y(T), α(T), ρ_e(T), κ(T)), provided in tabulated or fitted analytic forms.\n• The rod is not superconducting; magnetic permeability μ of copper is weakly temperature-dependent, but for simplicity, set μ ≈ μ₀ everywhere.\n\nMechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic boundary and initial conditions:\n1) At X = 0 (clamped end, r = R₁): u(0, t) = 0 (no displacement), adiabatic (∂T/∂X = 0), and electrically grounded (φ(0, t) = 0), where φ is the electric potential.\n2) At X = L₀ (free end, r = R₂): Prescribed temperature T(L₀, t) = T₁(t), thermally insulated (no additional heat flux), mechanically traction-free (σ(L₀, t) = 0), and electrically insulated (J(L₀, t) = 0).\n3) Initial conditions: At t = 0, T(X, 0) = T₀, u(X, 0) = 0, stress-free, φ(X, 0) = 0.\n\nElectromagnetic effects:\n• All EM fields are described by the 1-D Maxwell equations, with the fields assumed approximately uniform across the cross-section at each fixed X; displacement current is retained if timescales demand.\n• The EMF across the rod at time t is to be computed as ΔV(t), i.e., the potential difference between X = 0 and X = L₀, accounting for both the time-varying B-field (Faraday transformer EMF) and the motional EMF from the rod's material velocity in the rotating frame.\n• Induced electric current results in Joule heating (included as a source term in the thermal equation).\n\nMaterial behavior:\n• The rod's axial constitutive relation is: σ(X, t) = Y(T)·ε_e(X, t), where ε_e is the elastic strain (finite strain formulation), and plastic flow occurs for |σ| ≥ σ_Y(T), described by a rate-dependent, temperature-sensitive plasticity model (e.g., Perzyna or Prandtl-Reuss).\n• Total strain is ε(X, t) = ∂u/∂X + 0.5(∂u/∂X)^2, decomposed into elastic, plastic, and thermal parts: ε = ε_e + ε_p + ε_th, with ε_th(X, t) = α(T)·[T(X, t) − T₀].\n\nTransport laws:\n• Ohm’s law: J(X, t) = σ_e(T)·[E(X, t) + v(X, t) × B⃗ (x(X, t), t)], where σ_e(T) is the electrical conductivity.\n• Fourier’s law: heat flux q(X,t) = −κ(T)·∂T/∂X.\n• The body force per unit mass in the rotating frame includes centrifugal force: f_cent(X, t) = ω^2 x(X, t), and no Coriolis or Euler forces (ω constant, displacements along x̂, and velocities small compared to ωR₁).\n\nTasks:\n(a) Explicitly write down the coupled system of 1-D PDEs for temperature T(X, t), displacement u(X, t), stress σ(X, t), electric field E(X, t), and current J(X, t), including all non-linear constitutive relations and source terms (thermal expansion, Joule heating, body forces, plasticity), stating all model coefficients and their temperature dependence.\n(b) List all boundary and initial conditions as above in full symbolic form.\n(c) Write an explicit expression for the total EMF ΔV(t) between fixed and free ends, incorporating both transformer and motional terms, using the actual (possibly time-dependent) mapping x(X, t) and B⃗ (x, t).\n(d) Outline a finite element algorithm (in 1-D) to numerically solve the coupled multiphysics PDE system under the given conditions, comment on main computational challenges (e.g., plasticity, large strain convergence, strong coupling), and suggest strategies for stability and accuracy (time-stepping, mesh adaptivity, implicit-explicit splitting).\n\nAll necessary functional forms (e.g., α(T), Y(T), σ_e(T), κ(T), σ_Y(T)) are provided in tabulated analytic fits as data sheets; you may refer to them explicitly as functions, without enumerating values."
"You are tasked with analyzing a double pendulum system installed inside a cylindrical laboratory chamber of radius R aboard a next-generation space station. The space station rotates about its longitudinal axis with a controlled, time-dependent angular velocity ω(t) = ω₀ + α sin(ϕ t), where α ≪ ω₀ and ϕ are known experimental parameters. The chamber is equipped with an artificial gravity system that produces a radial acceleration field g_mod(r, t) = β r² cos(Λ t), where β and Λ are tunable, and r is the distance from the rotation axis. The total effective 'vertical' at a given radial coordinate is defined as the net radial outward direction resulting from both centrifugal forces and g_mod; for all times, these fields are co-linear and strictly radial. For numerical reference, let g₀ = ω₀²R be the baseline centrifugal acceleration at the chamber wall (r = R).\n\nThe double pendulum assembly consists of:\n1. A uniform, rigid rod of length ℓ₁ (mass m₁, constant moment of inertia I₁ = m₁ℓ₁²/3). The rod's Young's modulus oscillates as E(t) = E₀ + η sin(π t / T), causing a small (≪ 1%) time-dependent correction δI₁(t) to its moment of inertia. The explicit relationship is δI₁(t) = κ I₁ η sin(π t / T) / E₀, where κ is a dimensionless material constant.\n2. Suspended from the rod’s tip is an ideal, massless, yet extensible (not inextensible) string whose equilibrium length oscillates as ℓ₂(t) = ℓ₂₀ + δℓ sin(χ t + φ₀), with δℓ ≪ ℓ₂₀. The actual length responds adiabatically to prescribed variations. The bob on the string has mass m₂.\n\nThe pivot point is located at radius r₀ ≪ R from the axis. Motions are restricted to a physical plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, enforced by mechanical guides. The angular displacements θ₁(t), θ₂(t) are measured from the local net radial direction, i.e., the effective outward 'vertical.'\n\nThermal and quantum environments:\n- The chamber is maintained at temperature T_lab ≪ ℏω₀/k_B, so thermal occupation of oscillator modes is negligible. Quantum ground-state (“zero-point”) fluctuations are appreciable.\n- Oscillations of θ₁, θ₂ up to 60° occur; no small-angle approximations are allowed.\n\nStochastic effects and damping:\n- Residual gas collisions produce random additive torques on both arms, modeled as τ_noise,i(t) (i = 1,2) satisfying ⟨τ_noise,i(t) τ_noise,j(t')⟩ = 2 b k_B T_noise δ_ij δ(t − t'), where b is the viscous damping coefficient (same for both hinges), and T_noise is the effective noise temperature (which may differ from T_lab and can be set to zero if desired).\n\nAt initial time t = 0, the arms are held at rest at known angles θ₁(0), θ₂(0), with angular velocities zero. At t = t₀ > 0, an impulsive, perpendicular laser pulse imparts an angular momentum ΔL to the bob (mass m₂) only.\n\nTasks:\n1. Derive the fully nonlinear equations of motion for θ₁(t), θ₂(t) in the rotating (non-inertial) reference frame, explicitly including (a) centrifugal and Coriolis forces to all orders in θ, (b) the time-dependent artificial gravity g_mod(r, t) evaluated at relevant positions, (c) time-dependent string length and moment of inertia, (d) damping, and (e) the noise torques τ_noise,1(t), τ_noise,2(t). State and justify all assumptions about mechanical modulations and noise statistics. Clearly specify the form of the stochastic differential equations, including the impulsive ΔL at t₀ as a jump in ˙θ₂.\n2. At time t = t₀ (just after the impulse, with new initial velocities), linearize the noiseless equations about the instantaneous equilibrium (θ₁, θ₂) and compute the classical normal mode frequencies, retaining all system parameter dependencies. Determine the leading-order quantum zero-point correction to the energy of each mode (at T_lab → 0), giving explicit formulas in terms of ω₀, ℏ, and the relevant masses and effective frequencies.\n3. Write the coupled Langevin equations for θ₁, θ₂, and explicitly solve for the time evolution of the mean displacements ⟨θ₁(t)⟩, ⟨θ₂(t)⟩ for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2T (one full period of Young's modulus modulation), under the influence of damping b, random torques τ_noise,i (white-noise as defined), and the impulse ΔL at t₀. Discuss conditions of validity for the solution (e.g., stationarity of noise, small modulations).\n4. Compute the average power dissipated due to damping and noise in the long-time limit, and derive the stationary joint probability distribution P(θ₁, θ₂, ˙θ₁, ˙θ₂) for the amplitudes and velocities, assuming the effective temperature T_noise ≪ ℏω₀/k_B.\n5. Suppose α/ω₀ and β/g₀ are increased slowly such that adiabatic following applies. For small but nonzero δℓ and η, analyze and predict the classical stability boundaries for parametric resonance, and estimate the threshold ratio (α/ω₀)_c (and β/g₀)_c above which the lowest normal mode becomes unstable. Compare to the quantum case (T_lab → 0) and explain how quantum noise shifts the instability threshold. Give explicit inequalities or formulas for the critical parameters, clearly relating them to modulation depths, damping, and noise spectral power.\n\nIn each part, carefully state all physical and mathematical assumptions, justify all approximations, and provide a physical interpretation for any resonance, bifurcation, or noise-induced effects that emerge due to the coupling of rotation, artificial gravity, material property modulation, and stochastic forces."
"A lunar rocket is launched vertically from the Moon’s surface (y = 0) to a target altitude y_f (>0), with the aim of maximizing its final vertical velocity v_f at y = y_f. The rocket consists of:\n- A dry structure of mass m_dry, and on board are both n moles of helium gas (molar mass M_He) and m_fuel kg of chemical propellant (initially unburnt).\n- The helium is contained in a thermally insulated, massless piston chamber of initial volume V_0 and maximum possible volume V_max; both chamber and piston have the same fixed cross-sectional area A.\n- The piston expansion is strictly adiabatic and reversible inside the chamber until it is stopped at V_max, but during expansion, the external pressure is maintained at a small nonzero value P_ext ≪ P_initial, ensuring both finite work output and the possibility of near-reversible expansion. The total work output W_He from helium expansion is transferred \u2014 via a lossless, mechanically coupled powertrain \u2014 into the chemical rockets\u2019 fuel-feed system, thereby powering turbopumps to permit increased peak propellant mass flow (\u1E41_max) compared to operation without He expansion. The helium subsystem and its mass remain attached to the rocket throughout ascent.\n\nThe total mechanical work from He expansion is determined by integrating the van der Waals equation of state (He has parameters a, b, and a constant-volume heat capacity C_v = (3/2) n R), with the adiabatic expansion proceeding until either V_max or the minimum temperature T_min > 0 (specified) is reached \u2014 whichever comes first.\n\nChemical propulsion provides thrust F_chem = \u1E41(t) v_e, where v_e is the (constant) exhaust velocity and \u1E41(t) is the time-dependent controllable fuel flow (rate capped by \u1E41_max, which can itself be increased by the available He work as explained below). Nozzle characteristics and fuel type fix v_e; all chemical fuel is standard (the helium is used only for ancillary power and not as propellant).\n\nLunar gravity varies with altitude as g(y) = g_0 [R_moon / (R_moon + y)]^2, with known g_0 and lunar radius R_moon. Neglect all aerodynamic drag and rotational/Moon motion effects.\n\nDuring ascent, the rocket may encounter unanticipated, localized gravity 'wells'. Each well is spacelike: it sits between y and y + d_well, exerts a known additional acceleration \u0394g (>0) only within its span, and always requires a fixed, excess fuel cost \u03b4m_fuel to be traversed regardless of speed or optimal control. The locations of wells are random but follow a Poisson process in space with rate \u03bb (mean number = \u03bb y_f for total ascent). Wells are traversed instantaneously for deterministic calculation purposes, and their cumulative effect is included only via the expected total cost (\u03bb y_f \u03b4m_fuel).\n\nThe entirety of the He (n moles) is retained by the rocket; non-ideality is fully modelled (van der Waals), and links between m_He, n, and M_He are always explicit. The dry mass m_dry includes the structural, piston/cylinder, and all ancillary system masses except m_He and m_fuel. All variables and parameters (including n, m_He, M_He, m_dry, m_fuel, V_0, V_max, T_0, T_min, a, b, C_v, v_e, P_ext, \u1E41_max, d_well, \u0394g, \u03bb, \u03b4m_fuel, y_f, g_0, R_moon, and A) are precisely defined and must appear in your solution where relevant. The control problem is:\n\n1. **Helium Expansion**: Compute the maximal mechanical work W_He that can be extracted from n moles of van der Waals He initially at (V_0, T_0), expanding reversibly and adiabatically against external pressure P_ext \u2267 0, up to volume V_max or T_min, whichever occurs first. Express W_He exactly (with definite integrals as needed), and explicitly state the adiabatic trajectory T(V) for van der Waals He.\n2. **Propellant Feed Dynamics**: Given that the feed system can draw power from both an onboard (fixed) battery reserve E_batt and the He-derived W_He, model how total available power maximizes admissible fuel-feed \u1E41_max^* (instantaneous or time-averaged), subject to the propellant system\u2019s known efficiency \u03b7_feed (<1). Relate \u1E41_max^* to W_He and E_batt, specifying all thermomechanical steps.\n3. **Ascent Equations**: Write the full equations of motion for vertical ascent, including altitude-dependent mass (m(t) = m_dry + m_He + m_fuel(t)), vertical speed, and varying gravity g(y), together with the time-dependent thrust F_chem and mass flow constraint \u1E41(t) \u2264 \u1E41_max^*. Ignore any effect of gravity wells in dynamics (incorporate them only as a mean total extra fuel budget as below).\n4. **Stochastic Fuel Cost for Gravity Wells**: Compute the expected total extra fuel requirement from stochastic gravity wells, as a function of \u03bb, \u03b4m_fuel, and y_f, justifying the calculation.\n5. **Optimal Fuel Flow and Ascent Strategy**: For all physically admissible control profiles \u1E41(t), find (a) the time-profile that minimizes total initial fuel required to guarantee arrival at y_f with v_f \u2265 0 (including expected fuel for gravity wells and both chemical and He-derived power), and (b) the corresponding minimal initial m_fuel,expressed in terms of all parameters and with exact integral/differential equations as required. Justify any optimization method used (e.g., Pontryagin Maximum Principle), and show explicit steps linking control theory, variable-mass dynamics, and the auxiliary power constraints from He expansion.\n6. **Numerical Example**: Provide an explicit calculation for given example parameter values (provide concrete numbers for all symbols), numerically evaluating the minimal fuel requirement and optimal ascent control. Include detailed steps and expressions from parts 1\u20135.\n\nAll derivations must rigidly distinguish between mass, mole number, and energy source roles; express all formulae exactly as possible (definite integrals allowed where irreducible), and rigorously justify every step with no neglected variables, ambiguous couplings, or contradiction of thermodynamic/control theory or stochastic logic. State all physical assumptions clearly."
"Consider two identical solid, neutral, type-I superconducting microspheres of radius a, mass m, London penetration depth λ_L ≪ a, and coherence length ξ (Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ ≪ 1), each isolated in vacuum and cooled to temperature T ≪ T_c. Each sphere is placed in a separate, independent three-dimensional harmonic potential well of angular frequency ω_trap, with both well centers separated by a fixed distance L along the x-axis and at height h above an infinite, perfectly conducting, grounded plane (the z = 0 plane). The ambient temperature is sufficiently low that k_B T ≪ ħω_trap, and all environments external to the trapping system may be modeled as a quantum Ohmic Markovian bath with (negligible) non-Markovian corrections.\n\nAt time t = 0, the system is prepared such that both spheres are in minimum-uncertainty ground states in their respective traps. External electromagnetic fields are absent: E_ext = 0, B_ext = 0. Both spheres and the planar boundary are uncharged and unpolarized in the ground state. The presence of the grounded plane, however, modifies the quantized electromagnetic vacuum modes through boundary conditions (but there is no cavity photon mode; the plane is not a cavity wall).\n\nThe leading conservative interactions are: (1) gravitational attraction between the spheres, (2) Casimir–Polder force between each sphere and the plane due to London screening and finite λ_L (use the proximity force/VdW limit applicable to perfect conductors with weak nonlocal corrections), and (3) trap-induced harmonic forces. Coulomb, magnetic dipole, and higher multipole electric/magnetic effects are all negligible (the microspheres are true type-I, neutral and non-magnetic; Meissner effect enforces expulsion of all applied magnetic field; all residual fields are zero).\n\n(a) Construct the total system Hamiltonian for the two coupled center-of-mass degrees of freedom, fully specifying the kinetic, gravitational, Casimir–Polder, and harmonic confining terms. Show explicitly how the presence of the conducting plane modifies the spectrum of the electromagnetic vacuum relevant for Casimir–Polder forces, and express all corrections to leading nontrivial order in λ_L/a.\n\n(b) Under the assumption of weak system-bath coupling and using the Born–Markov and rotating wave approximations, derive the Lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix of the composite system, including decoherence and dissipation induced by the quantum Ohmic environment acting independently on each sphere’s center-of-mass. Specify the Lindblad operators and explicitly show how the finite thermal occupation impacts the stationary motional state. \n\n(c) For realistic parameters (a = 1 μm, m = 10⁻¹⁴ kg, h = 5a, L = 10a, λ_L = 10 nm, ω_trap = 2π×100 kHz, T = 50 mK), quantify the rates of (i) gravitational-induced entanglement generation between the spheres (neglecting all other coupling), (ii) Casimir–Polder-induced motional frequency shifts, and (iii) environmental decoherence due to the bath at temperature T. By comparing these timescales, determine whether spatial quantum entanglement between the sphere’s center-of-mass wavepackets can be generated and detected for durations τ > 1/γ_dec, where γ_dec is the environmental decoherence rate. Discuss observable signatures and outline a protocol for detecting such quantum correlations via motional state tomography.\n\n(d) Estimate the leading-order correction to the Hamiltonian due to center-of-mass relativistic kinetic energy expansion in v/c and discuss under what physical conditions these corrections become relevant. Explicitly state all assumptions and approximations used throughout, and give parameter regimes where your analysis breaks down."
"A cylindrical space station of inner radius R_tank = 5 m and height H_tank = 10 m in an otherwise weightless environment (g_0 = 0) rotates at constant angular velocity Ω about its z-axis, generating artificial gravity g_eff = Ω^2 R_tank at the tank wall. The rotation axis is instantaneously tilted by a small angle θ ≪ 1 about the x-axis from the lab (inertial) frame and coerced to slowly precess around the y-axis at constant rate Ω_prec ≪ Ω. Let the cylinder's base (z = 0) coincide with the geometric minimum of a rigid, perfectly reflecting paraboloidal mirror z_m(r) = z_m0 + A r^2 (with z_m0 = 0 and A = 0.1 m^{-1}), forming the bottom of the tank—no physical space exists below. The tank is completely filled with an incompressible, inviscid, Boussinesq-stratified liquid water column with vertical temperature gradient γ = 2 K/m so that T(z) = T_0 + γz, 0 ≤ r ≤ R_tank, 0 ≤ z ≤ D = 8 m, with water density ρ_water(z) = ρ_0 [1 – α_T γ z] where ρ_0 = 1000 kg/m^3 and α_T = 3.0 × 10^{-4} K^{-1}. The refractive index in water is n_water(z) = n_0 + κ γ z with n_0 = 1.33 and κ = 3.3 × 10^{-5} K^{-1}. The upper water surface at z = z_surf(r) forms a free surface (pressure = p₀). The lateral wall at r = R_tank is impermeable and enforces free-slip (∂u_r/∂r = 0, u_z = 0, no radial flux).\n\nA solid, non-deformable axisymmetric paraboloid body of height H_s = 2 m and maximum radius R_s = 0.8 m, with apex at z = z_a = 1 m, is suspended by a massless inextensible cable of known length L_cable = 6.5 m, anchored at z_Q = 9 m, r = 0. The solid's density profile is ρ_s(z) = ρ_s0 + β_s (z – z_a)^2, with ρ_s0 = 1200 kg/m^3 and β_s = 50 kg/m^5. The paraboloid is always fully submerged with its rotation-symmetry axis aligned with (but not attached to) the cable. All geometric relations—paraboloid geometry, tank, and mirror—are fully specified in (r, z), with r = 0 the tank axis and the base z_m(0) = 0.\n\nInitial conditions: At t = 0, the space station rotates at Ω = 1.4 rad/s, axis upright (θ = 0), no precession. At t > 0, the axis is instantaneously tilted by θ = 0.06 radians about x and forced to precess at Ω_prec = 0.05 rad/s about y. The problem is to be solved in the tank-body (rotating) frame; all expressions must be first order in θ, Ω_prec/Ω, and γH_tank, and neglect all higher-order terms and dissipative effects.\n\nTasks:\n\n(A) Derive the full hydrostatic pressure field p(r, z) in the rotating, precessing tank-body frame, including all first-order effects of rotation Ω, tilt θ, and precession Ω_prec, up to O(θ), O(Ω_prec/Ω), and O(γ), using the Boussinesq approximation. Express the analytic formula for the free surface z_surf(r), and specify all boundary conditions at z = z_m(r), r = R_tank, and the free surface. Show explicitly the centrifugal, Euler, and Coriolis contributions to the effective acceleration.\n\n(B) Compute the net buoyancy force and torque that the stratified water exerts on the fully submerged axisymmetric solid paraboloid both in equilibrium (no precession) and under small-amplitude oscillations (with precession). Account for the spatial offset between the solid's center of mass and its center of buoyancy as determined by the vertical density gradient and paraboloid geometry. Derive the coupled linear equations for small angular oscillations of the suspended paraboloid about the tank’s z-axis, explicitly including parametric driving from the precession and restoring torques from time-dependent buoyancy. The cable’s point of attachment, length, and rigid suspension must be used to set torque boundary conditions.\n\n(C) Perform a linear stability analysis: Determine precisely the conditions for parametric resonance of the coupled solid-water system, expressing the instability threshold and growth rate of the dominant mode(s) in terms of Ω, Ω_prec, θ, γ, α_T, β_s, and all geometric tank and paraboloid parameters. Specify parameter regimes where the paraboloid undergoes large excursions, and estimate the critical value of Ω_prec or θ at which overturning first occurs.\n\n(D) A collimated laser beam of vacuum wavelength λ_0 = 532 nm enters vertically downward at r = 0, just above the water surface. Using the full eikonal (Hamiltonian ray) formalism, treat the water as a weakly stratified graded-index medium (|κ γ D| ≪ n_0) and the air-water interface as a refracting surface via Snell's law. For a ray initially parallel to z at r = 0, derive the vertical deflection Δr_f from the central axis at the mirror (z = z_m(r)) in the paraxial and small-angle limit. Give the explicit first-order correction to the ray’s focal point due to the index gradient (κ), and quantify its dependence on rotation Ω and precession Ω_prec via the surface shape z_surf(r). Express all results in terms of n_0, κ, γ, Ω, Ω_prec, θ, tank radius, and paraboloid/mirror geometry.\n\n(E) With all parameters as specified above, numerically simulate: (i) the time evolution of the tank’s free surface for t ∈ [0, 30 s], (ii) the coupled angular dynamics of the suspended paraboloid for small oscillations over this interval, and (iii) the refracted path and focal spot of a single vertical light ray, including all O(θ), O(Ω_prec/Ω), and O(γ) corrections. Display graphically: the time-dependent free surface profile, the paraboloid's apex trajectory, and the axial light displacement at the mirror. Identify numerically the onset of instability and the critical optical caustic shift as precession is increased.\n\nAll calculations must explicitly justify each approximation, define every symbol, and specify boundary and initial conditions. Discuss at least two next-order physical effects neglected here (surface tension, fluid viscosity, solid deformation, finite stratification relaxation time), and propose a realistic experimental modification to test the model’s predictions."

Use the base of the vessel ($z = 0$) as the zero of gravitational potential. Let the gravitational potential energy per unit mass at height $z$ be $U_g(z) = gz$.\n\nAssume that during partition removal, the mechanical work performed by the partition equals the change in the total energy of the gases (internal plus gravitational), i.e., any imbalance in column weights is converted into gas energy or extracted as work on the vessel walls.\n\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\n\\textbf{\\underline{Required tasks:}}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[a)]\n    \\item For both compartments ($\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$), derive an expression for their initial total (internal + gravitational) energy in terms of $n_i$, $T_i$, $g$, $h$, and constants.

The axis passes through the lowest point of the bowl. \n\nAt $t=0$, the particle is instantaneously released \n(a) **from rest in the bowl's rotating frame** (so its velocity in the inertial frame equals the local azimuthal velocity of the bowl; that is, the particle is co-rotating with the bowl at the moment of release), \n(b) **from the rim** ($\\theta=0$), and then slides under gravity and all inertial (fictitious) forces consistent with the rotating frame.\n\n**Coordinate System and Conventions:**\n- Use spherical-polar coordinates $(r,\\theta,\\varphi)$ where $r$ is radial distance from the bowl's center of curvature, $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the symmetry axis, with $\\theta=0$ at the rim (topmost), $\\theta = \\pi/2$ at the bowl's nadir (lowest point), and $\\varphi$ is the azimuthal angle.\n- The particle is constrained to always move along the surface: $r=R$.\n\n**Forces and Dynamics:**\n- In the rotating frame, the particle experiences gravitational, centrifugal, and Coriolis forces.

The chamber is oriented vertically, and the gas is sealed by a frictionless piston of mass $m_p$. Above the piston, there is a perfect vacuum. Initially, the entire setup is at rest on Earth's surface, where the acceleration due to gravity is $g_0$. The gas is initially at a uniform temperature $T_i$. In this initial state, the gas is in mechanical and thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, and its pressure is solely determined by the weight of the piston.\n\nA parallel-plate capacitor is integrated into the chamber such that the gas fills the entire volume between its plates. The capacitor has plate area $A_{cap}$ and plate separation $d_{cap}$. This capacitor is permanently connected to an external battery providing a constant voltage $V_B$. The battery maintains this constant voltage across the capacitor plates, supplying or drawing charge as necessary to accommodate changes in capacitance.\n\nThe relative dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_r$ of this specific monatomic ideal gas is known to follow the empirical relation $\\varepsilon_r = 1 + \\mathcal{K} \\frac{P}{T}$, where $P$ is the absolute pressure of the gas, $T$ is its absolute temperature, and $\\mathcal{K}$ is a given constant specific to the gas.

The system is open to the environment and all arms come instantly to the ambient temperature.\n\nThe copper rod $R_2$ spans $L=0.100\\,\\mathrm{m}$, with circular cross-section of radius $r=0.400\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and electrical resistivity\n\\[\\rho_{\\text{Cu},0} = 1.72\\times 10^{-8}\\,\\Omega\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{m} \\text{ at } T_0\\,\\]\nwith temperature coefficient\n\\[\\alpha_{\\text{Cu}}=3.90\\times10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}.\n\\]\nThe platinum resistor (arm $DA$) has resistivity\n\\[\\rho_{\\text{Pt},0} = 1.06 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\Omega\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{m} \\text{ at } T_0\\]\nand temperature coefficient\n\\[\\alpha_{\\text{Pt}}=3.93\\times10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}.\n\\]\nAll three copper arms are identical (arms $AB$, $BC$, $CD$) and made of the described geometry/material; arm $DA$ is a platinum wire of the same length and radius as the copper rods.\n\nAt $T_0$, the bridge is perfectly balanced and the galvanometer reads zero.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the entire bridge is suddenly heated to $T = T_0 + \\Delta T$, with $\\Delta T = 75.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and held isothermal. The current source and null detector remain ideal at all times.\n\nSimultaneously, a uniform magnetic field of magnitude\n\\[B = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{T}\\]\nis switched on perpendicular to the axis of the $BC$ rod; the rod is mounted to slide frictionlessly along rails in a direction orthogonal to both its axis (length $L$) and the field $B$. The rails are ideal (zero resistance, infinite conductivity, massless), and do not themselves move or induce any emf. The rod has mass density $\\rho_{m,\\text{Cu}} = 8.93 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. There is negligible mechanical friction, and the magnetic field is uniform and switched on slow enough to induce no voltages apart from those due to rod motion in steady $B$. The bridge is in air, and neither resistors nor rod self-heat.\n\nAs $R_2$ moves, it develops a motional emf $\\mathcal{E}(t) = B L v(t)$, with $v(0)=0$ and $F=I_2(t) B L$, where $I_2(t)$ is the actual current at time $t$ through arm $BC$; the rod starts from rest. The rod has mass $m=\\rho_{m,\\text{Cu}} \\pi r^2 L$.\n\nLet all temperature dependences be strictly linear as specified: for any relevant resistor,\n\\[R_i(T) = R_{0}\\big[1+\\alpha_i(T-T_0)\\big]\\]\nwhere $\\alpha_1=\\alpha_2=\\alpha_3=\\alpha_{\\text{Cu}}$ and $\\alpha_4=\\alpha_{\\text{Pt}}$.\n\nAssume:\n- The division of $I_{\\text{in}}$ between the $ABA$ and $CDA$ paths is determined by the actual instantaneous resistances and (if present) the motional emf in arm $BC$ under Kirchhoff's laws.\n- Only the motional emf generated by arm $BC$ is nonzero.\n- All physical parameters (dimensions, $\\rho$, $\\alpha$) remain as defined during the process.\n- Ignore thermal expansion and all parasitic effects not described.\n\nLet the bridge become re-balanced at the earliest time $\\tau>0$ such that the potential difference between nodes $B$ and $D$ is again exactly zero (null detector reads zero):\n\\[V_B - V_D = 0\\]\n\nCalculate numerically, to three significant digits, the value of $\\boxed{\\tau}$ in seconds at which the Wheatstone bridge achieves this re-balance."
