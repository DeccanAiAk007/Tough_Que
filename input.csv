question
"A solid, uniform cylinder of height h = 0.40 m and radius R = 0.15 m is made from an aluminum alloy with mass M = 19.8 kg and initial temperature T₀ = 293 K (20°C). The cylinder is fully immersed and floats upright (axis vertical) in a large tank of water at temperature T₀. The densities at T₀ are: ρ_al(T₀) = 2700 kg/m³ (aluminum, at 20°C) and ρ_w(T₀) = 998 kg/m³ (water, at 20°C). The coefficient of volumetric thermal expansion for aluminum is β = 7.2 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹. The coefficient of volumetric thermal expansion for water near room temperature is γ = 2.1 × 10⁻⁴ K⁻¹. The cylinder is slowly and uniformly heated (with perfect thermal contact) so that its temperature rises; the water is simultaneously heated at the same rate, so their temperatures always remain equal (at temperature T). Assume that the aluminum cylinder's mass remains constant, only its volume changes with temperature, and the density of both aluminum and water vary with temperature solely due to isotropic thermal expansion. Neglect evaporation, convection, or surface tension. Atmospheric pressure is constant and does not affect your answer.
(i) Derive the temperature T₁ (in K, above T₀) at which the aluminum cylinder will just become neutrally buoyant and start to sink.
(ii) Re-express your answer in terms of the cylinder's parameters (M, h, R), the coefficients of expansion, and the initial densities.
(iii) Using the values above, calculate numerically T₁ to the correct number of significant figures. Is it physically feasible for the cylinder to sink before water boils (T = 373 K)?"
