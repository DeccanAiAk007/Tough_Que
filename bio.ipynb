Strain A is engineered such that the only functional hexose transporter is Hxt7 (high-capacity, low-affinity), whose maximum velocity $V_{\\\\max}=600\\\\ \\\\mathrm{pmol\\\\ Glc\\\\ cell^{-1}\\\\ h^{-1}}$ and $K_M=5.0$ mM (Michaelis constant) are known.

      "  \"question\": \"A closed population of insular deer (\\\\textit{Cervus insulae}) has been experimentally engineered to express a homozygous gain-of-function allele \\\\textit{mem}\\\\textsuperscript{+} in the GluN2B subunit of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron NMDA receptor. This allele increases the mean time each receptor channel spends open upon synaptic activation, enhancing memory capacity but increasing neuronal calcium (Ca\\\\textsuperscript{2+}) influx and, correspondingly, hippocampal energy cost. \\n\\nA. \\\\textbf{Neurobiological Details:}\\n\\nAll CA1 neurons are isopotential, each with a soma membrane area of $A_\\\\mathrm{mem} = 2100\\\\ \\\\mu\\\\mathrm{m}^2$ evenly divided among $N_\\\\mathrm{syn} = 30{,}000$ glutamatergic synapses per neuron. Each synapse contains $N_\\\\mathrm{NMDAR} = 5$ GluN2B NMDA receptor channels, all with an individual channel permeability $P_\\\\mathrm{Ca} = 6.0\\\\times10^{-17}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}^3\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$, and each channel occupies $a_\\\\mathrm{ch} = 20\\\\ \\\\mathrm{nm}^2$ of membrane. \\n\\nFor each synaptic event, an NMDAR channel opens with probability $p_\\\\mathrm{open} = 0.35$, and the mean open time is $\\\\tau_\\\\mathrm{open,mem^{+}} = 150.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{ms}$. Synaptic drive is a stationary Poisson process with mean activation frequency $\\\\nu_\\\\mathrm{syn} = 4.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Hz}$ per synapse. \\n\\nDuring channel open state, the membrane potential is voltage clamped at $V_\\\\mathrm{m,open} = -20.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{mV}$; in all other periods, channels are closed and negligible calcium influx occurs. The extracellular and intracellular Ca\\\\textsuperscript{2+} concentrations are $[\\\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_\\\\mathrm{out} = 2.0\\\\ \\\\mathrm{mol}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ and $[\\\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_\\\\mathrm{in} = 5.0\\\\times10^{-5}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{mol}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ respectively. \\n\\nThe Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation for a single channel's Ca\\\\textsuperscript{2+} current is:\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\nI_{\\\\mathrm{Ca}} = z^2 F^2 \\\\frac{A_\\\\mathrm{ch} P_\\\\mathrm{Ca} V_\\\\mathrm{m}}{R T} \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_\\\\mathrm{in} - [\\\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_\\\\mathrm{out} \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{z F V_\\\\mathrm{m}}{R T}\\\\right)}{1-\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{z F V_\\\\mathrm{m}}{R T}\\\\right)}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\nwhere $z = 2$, $F = 96\\\\,485\\\\ \\\\mathrm{C}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $R = 8.314\\\\ \\\\mathrm{J}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, temperature $T = 310\\\\ \\\\mathrm{K}$, and $M_\\\\mathrm{Ca} = 40.078\\\\ \\\\mathrm{g}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. Assume all ions entering through these channels are retained in the cytosol (buffering/extrusion compensation is ignored; see note). \\n\\nB. \\\\textbf{Population Details:}\\n\\nThe deer population is at carrying capacity $N_\\\\mathrm{deer} = 50\\\\,000$, each with $N_\\\\mathrm{CA1} = 5.0\\\\times 10^6$ CA1 pyramidal neurons. \\n\\nC. \\\\textbf{Experimental Context:} No other sources of calcium influx are present except the NMDAR channels described. All neurons remain healthy for exactly one sidereal year ($t_\\\\mathrm{year} = 3.156\\\\times10^{7}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{s}$). Note: You may assume that overlap of synaptic events or channel-open events is negligible, so total Ca\\\\textsuperscript{2+} charge influx sums linearly over channels, neurons, and deer for the time interval.  \\n\\n\\\\textbf{Table 1.

Each well contains 200 \\\\mu\\\\mathrm{L} medium, and every cDC1 is assumed spherical with a cellular volume of 1.2~\\\\mathrm{pL} (picoliters).\\n\\nAt time t = 0, each cDC1 is infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 by a recombinant Influenza A virus encoding nucleoprotein (NP) engineered to present the class I immunodominant peptide SIINFEKL (OVA_{257-264}) within the NP sequence. Upon infection, viral replication and host translation dynamics are as follows:\\n\\n**1. Viral NP Synthesis & Degradation**\\n- After a 600 s eclipse phase, host shut-off commences: host translation drops to 5\\\\% of pre-infection rates while viral translation rises sigmoidally. The intracellular NP concentration at any time t (in seconds, t > 600) is:\\n\\\\[\\n[\\\\mathrm{NP}](t) = \\\\frac{C_{\\\\max}}{1 + e^{-k_{NP}(t-t_{mid})}}\\n\\\\]\\n- C_{\\\\max} = 900 nM, k_{NP} = 3.5 \\\\times 10^{-4}~\\\\mathrm{s}^{-1}, t_{mid} = 10{,}800~\\\\mathrm{s}\\n- NP is uniformly processed by proteasomes to release SIINFEKL with a yield fraction \\\\delta = 0.007 per degraded NP.\\n\\n**2. Competitive Peptide Supply to TAP & ER**\\n- Peptide pool delivered to the ER includes both viral (SIINFEKL) and host-derived peptides. In the infected cell, host peptide supply is 20-fold less than pre-infection.\\n- At t > 600 s, per-cell cytosolic peptide concentrations are:\\n\\\\[\\n[\\\\mathrm{SIINFEKL}](t) = \\\\delta \\\\cdot [\\\\mathrm{NP}](t) \\\\\\\\\\n[\\\\mathrm{HOST}](t) = q_{host} = 80~\\\\mathrm{nM}\\n\\\\]\\n- The TAP transporter follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics for competitive substrates:\\n\\\\[\\nv_{tap,S}(t) = \\\\frac{V_{max} \\\\cdot [S](t)}{K_{m,S}\\\\big(1 + \\\\frac{[H](t)}{K_{m,H}} \\\\big) + [S](t)}\\n\\\\]\\nWhere S = SIINFEKL, H = host peptides. Constants:\\n- V_{max} = 1300 peptides/cell/s\\n- K_{m,S} = 250~\\\\mathrm{nM}, K_{m,H} = 60~\\\\mathrm{nM}\\n\\n**3. Peptide Loading & Complex Stability**\\n- Only TAP-transported peptides enter the ER; they compete for loading onto nascent H-2K^b molecules at the ER (3.5\\\\times 10^{5} H-2K^b/cell/30 min synthesized steadily post-infection).\\n- SIINFEKL loading efficiency is \\\\eta_{S} = 0.18; for HOST, \\\\eta_{H} = 0.11.\\n- The rate of SIINFEKL-H-2K^b complex appearance at the surface is given by transport delay \\\\tau_{ves} = 1500~\\\\mathrm{s}:\\n\\\\[\\nJ_{surf,S}(t) = \\\\eta_{S} \\\\cdot v_{tap,S}(t - \\\\tau_{ves})\\n\\\\]\\n- H-2K^b/SIINFEKL complexes decay with k_{deg,S} = 6.0 \\\\times 10^{-5}~\\\\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\\n\\n**4.
