The chain is released from rest. While falling, the overhanging portion pulls more of the chain off the table until the entire chain has left the table. Assume gravity acts downward with acceleration g, and neglect air resistance. The table edge is rounded so the chain makes a right angle without friction, and there is no energy loss as each link comes off the table. However, due to the finite stiffness of the chain, as each infinitesimal segment leaves the table and suddenly joins the hanging section, it experiences an impulsive inelastic 'jerk'—the segment vertically accelerates from zero (horizontal) velocity to the instantaneous velocity of the falling chain. Assume all such 'jerk' energy dissipation is lost from the system. (a) Derive an expression for the velocity v(x) of the falling chain as a function of x, the length of chain already hanging (with αL ≤ x ≤ L), taking into account both variable mass and the kinetic energy lost to the 'jerks' at the table edge. (b) Determine the total energy dissipated due to these 'jerks' by the time the entire chain has left the table.

      " cleaned_latex: A thin uniform circular ring of radius R and mass M is free to rotate without friction about its fixed vertical central axis z. A small bead of rest mass m (m not negligibly small) is rigidly attached to the rim so that it co-rotates with the ring. The combined system (ring + bead) is initially at rest at laboratory time t = 0. From that instant and until t = T a motor mounted on the axle delivers a time–dependent torque τ(t) = τ₀\\,(1 − t/T) , 0 ≤ t ≤ T , τ₀ and T are positive constants. No external torques act other than τ(t). Up to the instant of its release the bead cannot slide with respect to the ring, so the total moment of inertia is I = (M + m) R². at t = T/2 the bead is released instantaneously and subsequently moves freely in a straight line that is tangential to the rim at the release point; after release it experiences no forces. Ignore gravity and any interaction between bead and ring after release, and treat the bead relativistically once it is free. The ring continues to rotate under the same torque τ(t) for t > T/2, but for the purpose of this problem you need only consider the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ T/2. The speed of light is c. (i) Unless you can prove otherwise, assume the attachment mechanism does not itself add or remove energy. (ii) Subtle point: the motor torque is applied only to the ring, yet before release both ring and bead gain kinetic energy; account for this correctly. the following, expressing every result symbolically in terms of the given parameters (τ₀, T, R, M, m, c):\n",

      " cleaned_latex: Inside a sealed, perfectly thermally insulated elevator car of mass M (not needed numerically), a vertical cylinder of uniform cross-sectional area A is rigidly attached to the floor. The cylinder contains n moles of an ideal monatomic gas (ratio of heat capacities γ) and is closed at the top by a frictionless, mass m_p, perfectly conducting, thin piston whose upper face is in contact with vacuum (negligible external pressure). At t = 0 the elevator is stationary with respect to Earth, and the gas–piston system has reached mechanical and thermal equilibrium at temperature T_0, piston height h_0 (measured from the bottom of the cylinder), and pressure P_0. At t = 0^+, the elevator starts to move upward with a constant proper acceleration a (absolute value of (a) ≪ c so relativistic effects can be neglected). During the subsequent motion the cylinder walls prevent any heat exchange with the surroundings, and the process within the gas can be treated as quasi-static. Assume g is the local constant magnitude of the Earth’s gravitational field and that the gas itself has negligible weight compared with the piston. Ignore any heat capacity of the piston and cylinder walls. Answer the following questions symbolically. State clearly any additional assumptions you must invoke. (Unless explicitly required, do NOT insert numerical values.)\n",

      " cleaned_latex: A beam of positively charged relativistic mesons (charge q, rest mass m_0, proper mean lifetime _0) is injected at x = 0 with 3–momentum p_0{i} (absolute value of (p_0) m_0 c) and negligible transverse extent. In the region 0 x L there is a static, non-uniform magnetic field B(x) = B_0 (1 + x/L) {k}, absolute value of () < 1, and no electric field. Outside this region the field is zero. Gravity and radiation reaction are negligible. Because the field is everywhere parallel to {k} and the incoming momentum is along {i}, the meson’s speed magnitude can be taken constant and equal to v c. Let (x) be the instantaneous (small) angle between the particle’s momentum and the +x direction as it moves through the field. Assume throughout that (i) absolute value of () 1, (ii) q B_0 L / p_0 1, and keep terms only to second order in . Neglect any spread in initial momenta. (a) Starting from the relativistic Lorentz force, obtain a differential equation for (x) and solve it to find an explicit expression for (x) in terms of q, B_0, p_0, L, , and x. (b) Using the result of (a) and the small-angle approximation, derive an expression, correct to {O}(^2), for the time of flight T(L) that a meson needs to cross the magnetic region (from x = 0 to x = L). (c) Let = sqrt(1 + (p_0/m_0 c)^2). Using special-relativistic time dilation, compute the probability P that a meson survives (i.e., has not yet decayed) when it exits at x = L. Keep terms up to {O}(^2) in the exponent and write P explicitly in symbolic form.\n",
