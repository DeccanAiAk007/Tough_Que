The launch point is defined as $x = 0, \\\\ z = 0$, with the $+z$ axis radially outward from the planet's center. The planet is non-rotating; its gravitational field is purely central ($\\\\vec{g}(\\\\vec{r}) = -\\\\dfrac{G M_p}{r^2} \\\\hat{r}$ for $r = R_p + z$; $G = 6.67430 \\\\times 10^{-11}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}^3\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$). There is no atmosphere and no planetary rotation. \\n\\nThe spacecraft starts from rest with an initial total mass (including the capsule; see below) $M_0 = 2.80 \\\\times 10^5\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kg}$ and burns fuel by expelling mass downward at constant exhaust speed $v_{\\\\mathrm{ex}} = 3.00 \\\\times 10^3\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m/s}$, providing a constant upward thrust $F_{\\\\mathrm{th}} = 4.00 \\\\times 10^6\\\\,\\\\mathrm{N}$ (magnitude and direction, always along $+z$). The only external force during ascent is gravity; the thrust vector always passes through the center of mass.

Non-gravitational forces are always defined in reference to the $+x$ and $+z$ basis vectors, with electric field $E_0$ strictly along $+z$, and magnetic field $B_0$ strictly along $+y$. There is never any component along $x$ or $-z$.\\n\\nImmediately after ejection ($t=0$), the capsule's position is $x_0 = 0$, $z_0 = z_{\\\\mathrm{sep}}$, velocity components $(v_{x,0} = 0, \\\\ v_{z,0} = v_{z,\\\\mathrm{cap}})$ (all in the planet frame).\\n\\nThe capsule's equations of motion in the $x$-$z$ plane are:\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} &= \\\\frac{Q}{m_c} \\\\left( -\\\\frac{dz}{dt} B_0 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\[1em]\\n\\\\frac{d^2 z}{dt^2} &= \\\\frac{Q}{m_c}\\\\left( E_0 + \\\\frac{dx}{dt} B_0 \\\\right) - \\\\frac{G M_p (R_p + z)}{[x^2 + (R_p + z)^2]^{3/2}}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nwhere the $z$-component of gravity always points to the planet's center ($-\\\\hat{z}$ for $x=0$) and the Lorentz-force terms are correctly signed for $v_x \\\\hat{x}$ and $v_z \\\\hat{z}$ motions, $B_0$ along $\\\\hat{y}$.\\n\\nNeglect all forms of drag, radiation, relativistic, and rotational effects.
